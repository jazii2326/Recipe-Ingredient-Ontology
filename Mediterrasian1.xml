<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">PLACE the rice in a colander and rinse thoroughly under the tap until the water runs clear, then drain well. PLACE the rice and the cold water in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. COVER the saucepan, turn the heat down to very low, and cook for 15 minutes without lifting the lid. TURN off the heat and allow to stand 10 minutes more, still covered, then spoon the rice into a large bowl. MIX together the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves, then drizzle over the rice. MIX together gently to coat the rice with the sushi vinegar, then set aside to cool to room temperature. FOR instructions on how to fill, roll and eat sushi rolls scroll to the bottom of the page.?#&amp;SUSHI ROLL VARIATIONS?#&amp;The range of possible fillings for sushi rolls is enormous. By mixing and matching various ingredients you can create many different varieties. Here are a selection of our favorite sushi rolls (Each of the following sushi recipes makes 6 sushi rolls):?#&amp;Smoked salmon and asparagus sushi rolls. Cut 6 oz (170g) of smoked salmon into thin strips. Lightly steam 12 trimmed asparagus spears, then refresh them in cold water. Smear a small amount of wasabi in a horizontal line across the middle of each rice-topped nori sheet and arrange equal amounts of salmon and asparagus on top. Roll the sushi up and cut into 1&#189;-inch rounds to serve.?#&amp;Tuna and cucumber sushi rolls. Cut a 10 oz (280g) piece of very fresh raw tuna into thin strips. Peel and remove the seeds from half a small-sized cucumber and cut the flesh into thin strips. Smear a small amount of wasabi in a horizontal line across the middle of each rice-topped nori sheet and arrange equal amounts of tuna and cucumber on top. Roll the sushi up and cut into 1&#189;-inch rounds to serve.?#&amp;Shrimp and vegetable sushi rolls. Cut 12 large peeled, cooked shrimp in half lengthways. Peel and remove the seeds from half a small-sized cucumber and cut the flesh into thin strips. Trim and cut 2 scallions into thin diagonal slices and thinly slice the flesh of &#189; an avocado. Smear a small amount of wasabi in a horizontal line across the middle of each rice-topped nori sheet and arrange equal amounts of each filling on top. Roll the sushi up and cut into 1&#189;-inch rounds to serve.?#&amp;Tofu, sesame and mixed vegetable sushi rolls. Lightly toast 3 teaspoons of sesame seeds in a frying pan. Cut 7 oz (200g) of firm tofu into thin strips. Peel and grate a small carrot. Remove the stems from 6 fresh shitake mushrooms (or use soaked, dried mushrooms or regular mushrooms) and thinly slice the flesh. Wash and drain &#189; cup snow pea sprouts. Smear a small amount of wasabi in a horizontal line across the middle of each rice-topped nori sheet and arrange equal quantities of each filling on top.

MIX together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl until well combined and brush evenly over the halloumi and vegetable skewers. MARINATE the skewers for 10-20 minutes (optional, but it does maximize flavor). COOK the skewers on a hot grill for 8-10 minutes, turning and brushing regularly with any residual marinade. SERVE the skewers with lemon wedges for squeezing.?#&amp;Variations: Other vegetables such as peppers of various colors, eggplant, and mushrooms also work well. Add a touch of dried chili flakes or chili sauce to the marinade for a spicy kick. Replace the halloumi with shrimp, scallops or chicken. Try adding cubes of grilled halloumi to a classic Greek salad in place of feta.?#&amp;Serving suggestions: The cheese and vegetables should be cut to roughly the same size so that each piece has direct contact with the grill to ensure even cooking (you want the cheese to turn golden brown and just start to melt and the vegetables to be tender.) If you’re using bamboo or wooden skewers, soak them in water for around 30 minutes beforehand to prevent them from burning. You can also cook these skewers indoors using a stove-top grill pan or electric grill, or under a hot oven broiler.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">8 oz (230g) dried Puy lentils?#&amp;5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil?#&amp;1 carrot — finely diced?#&amp;2 shallots — finely diced (or use 1 small red onion)?#&amp;&#189; fennel bulb — finely diced (about 1&#189; cups worth)?#&amp;&#188; teaspoon dried thyme?#&amp;1 tablespoon white wine vinegar?#&amp;1 teaspoon Dijon mustard?#&amp;1 garlic clove — minced?#&amp;1 teaspoon salt?#&amp;&#188; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper?#&amp;2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">RINSE the lentils in water to remove any grit. BRING a large pot of water to a boil, add the lentils, reduce the heat to medium-high, and simmer for 20 minutes until just tender. WHILE the lentils cook, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan and cook the carrot, shallots and fennel for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. ADD the thyme and cook for a further 5 minutes. PLACE the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a screw-top jar with the vinegar, mustard, garlic, salt, pepper and parsley and shake well to mix. DRAIN the lentils, then toss them with the cooked vegetables and the vinaigrette until thoroughly combined. SERVE warm or at room temperature.?#&amp;Serving ideas: This salad makes a lovely summer salad served with barbecued or grilled chicken, fish, or seafood. You can also easily round it out to make a filling meal by adding a little cooked bacon, a handful of toasted walnuts or crumbled goat’s cheese, and serving with some crusty bread on the side. And it makes a very tasty topping for bruschetta.</Data></Cell>

HEAT 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. FORM golf ball-size spoonfuls of the mixture (about 1 heaped tablespoon each) and flatten slightly with the palm of your hand (dampen your hands first to help prevent sticking). FRY half the patties (about 9) for 4 minutes on each side until crisp and golden. REPEAT the process with the remaining olive oil and falafel mixture.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">SOAK the chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water, covered, on the kitchen bench (the dried chickpeas will swell to around 3 cups worth of soaked chickpeas). DRAIN the chickpeas well and place in a food processor. PULSE until they form a roughly chopped mixture. ADD the onion, garlic, tomato paste, rosemary, salt and pepper and pulse more, scraping the sides occasionally, until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture holds together. TRANSFER the mixture into a bowl and stir in the spinach, then let the mixture rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. HEAT 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. FORM the mixture into 8 fritters using the palm of your hand to flatten slightly (dampen your hands first to help prevent sticking). FRY half the fritters for 5 minutes on each side until crisp and golden. REPEAT the process with the remaining olive oil and fritters.?#&amp;Serving ideas: You can serve these fritters with salad and crusty bread, or between sliced ciabatta bread with tomato, red onion, arugula (rocket), shaved Parmesan cheese and either pesto-mayo or aioli. They&#39;re also delicious stuffed in pita pickets with salad vegetables, chili sauce (like sriracha) and feta or grilled halloumi cheese, which provides a salty cheesy contrast to the spinach. The fritters taste equally as good served in regular buns with traditional burger fixings like cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup and mustard.</Data></Cell>
