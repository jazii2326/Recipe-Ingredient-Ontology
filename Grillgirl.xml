Take a paring knife and score diagonally about &#188;” to 1/2”&#160; deep in a criss cross method. This will give the meat some texture.

Oil the grate so the meat will not stick. Place the meat on its side on the grate. Add your preferred wood for smoke- I added cherry wood.

Don’t overdo the sauce; use just enough to coat the bologna. Put the bologna back on the PBC and cook for 10-15 minutes. Just enough to set the glaze.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove and loosely cover the bologna with aluminum foil while you prep for your bologna sandwich. Take two pieces of Wonder Texas Toast, lie them on the grate and cook with the lid off until you see some grill marks.&#160; Slice the bologna to your desired thickness and then put mayonnaise, tomato, sliced onion and lettuce on your sandwich and enjoy.</Data></Cell>

If using a standard charcoal or gas grill, prepare to cook directly over the flame/heat source.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook the burgers, flipping midway through, until you’ve reached your desired internal temperature. I recommend using an internal read thermometer, like the Thermapen to test internal temps and know when your meat is done. For medium rare, go for 145 degrees, medium is 160 degrees. While grilling the burgers, grill the peppers until they have developed char marks on both sides.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the burgers and peppers and let them rest for a few minutes.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Overview?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the meat overnight, or for a minimum of 8 hours for maximum flavor. On the grill, the meat is going to hang on skewers to be as far away from the flame as possible and then transition to the grates at the end to ensure all pieces are fully dehydrated over the course of the cook.?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all the ingredients for the marinade, then pulse with a stick blender/immersion blender to fully mix all ingredients together and chop the fresh garlic.?#&amp;Slice the meat into 1/4” slices, removing all fat. Cut it in half so each strip is no longer than 5 inches in length and no longer than 4 inches in width.?#&amp;In large gallon zip lock bags, add the meat and the marinade and let marinate in the fridge overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing from the fridge?#&amp;?#&amp;Double up the skewers so that each piece is hanging from two skewers. The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&amp;Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&amp;On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&amp;Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&amp;Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&amp;**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&amp;After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&amp;Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&amp;Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks. Enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Then sear the Tri Tip on each side for 2 minutes, or until the internal temp reaches 130 for medium rare. Be mindful that the skinniest part of the triptip will cook faster than the thicker part of the meat, and also remember that this is a roast so it is best cooked to a medium rare, not well done.

Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the ribs and rub?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the dry rub ingredients together in a small bowl. Rather than specifying the exact amounts, focus on the percentages and make a proportional amount to the number of ribs you are smoking. I don’t like to run short on my rub and have to either skimp or make a second batch so I always err on the side of having some extra.?#&amp;Trim off any excessively large or loose pieces of fat or meat to the ribs. However, be sure to leave a nice even layer of fat on the topside so you end of with a trim and tidy shaped rib. Set all the ribs in a cookie sheet.?#&amp;Score both sides of the ribs in a 1” diamond shape pattern. Since the fat layer isn’t that thick, watch your depth and don’t score it as deep as you would on a brisket.?#&amp;Evenly smoother the yellow mustard on all six sides of each rib.?#&amp;Generously sprinkle the dry rub onto the ribs and work it into the score marks so that all six sides are evenly covered. See photos. Now take a photo and post it to Instagram to make your friends jealous.?#&amp;Cover the ribs with plastic and let the ribs setup in the fridge for at least one hour. Remember to pull them from the fridge and let them come up to temperature before they go onto the smoker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the smoker?#&amp;?#&amp;I used my Big Green Egg, but the overall procedure works on whatever smoker you are using. Always start with a clean smoker and good quality lump charcoal.?#&amp;?#&amp;Load your smoker with enough charcoal to sustain about a 4 hour cook. In the large BGE, this was about just under the &#189; mark to the line.?#&amp;Start a small fire and get the smoker up to 225. Keep a close eye on the size of the fire as it warms up so that the smoker doesn’t get too hot. At this stage it’s much harder to cool the fire down than it is to bump it up a few degrees.?#&amp;Open first beer.?#&amp;Add your wood of choice, which in this case was 2-3 chunks of Hickory.?#&amp;If you are using a BGE, add the plate setter and a water tray with hot (not cold!) water. I use medium size aluminum plans.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now you’re ready to put the ribs on the smoker. You did remember to take them out of the fridge before you started the fire right??#&amp;?#&amp;Smoking the ribs?#&amp;?#&amp;Load the ribs, bone down, fat side up on the grates, leaving about an inch between the ribs.?#&amp;Smoke the ribs at 225 for about two hours until the internal temperature gets to 180-185. I used a Flame Boss so I just dialed in the two probes and let the Flame Boss do the work. If you’re curious what internal temp any protein you’re cooking should reach, be sure to check out our BBQ Calculator!?#&amp;After about 165, occasionally spritz the ribs with Apple juice to keep them moist.?#&amp;While the ribs are smoking, prepare the Texas Crutch/Foil Stage broth. Do this well in advance of the ribs reaching their target temperature so that everything is done ahead of time. Somewhere around beer number 3 is a good time to shoot for.?#&amp;?#&amp;Texas Crutch/Foil Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix all of the broth ingredients together in a saucepan and simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes.If you are using an outdoor burner on your grill, watch the temperature so that it doesn’t get to a boil.?#&amp;Allow the broth to cool to room temperature and set aside covered.?#&amp;Set aside two large pieces of tin foil sized to the number and size of your ribs. Fold the edges up on one of them to make a shallow tray to receive the ribs and broth. &#160;?#&amp;Once the ribs have reached 180-185, place them in the foil tray, and gently, but generously spoon the room temperature (not cold) broth over the ribs.?#&amp;Fold all of the edges up and then cover it with the second piece of foil, overlapping any seams.?#&amp;Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 200-205, about one hour. I bumped up the temperature slightly on the smoker at this point, but you will need to use your own judgement there.?#&amp;?#&amp;Final: Set Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Return the smoker temperature to 225 or lower.?#&amp;Once the Texas Crutch phase is over, return the uncovered </Data></Cell>

The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&amp;Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&amp;On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&amp;Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&amp;Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&amp;**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&amp;After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&amp;Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&amp;Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks. Enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Then sear the Tri Tip on each side for 2 minutes, or until the internal temp reaches 130 for medium rare. Be mindful that the skinniest part of the triptip will cook faster than the thicker part of the meat, and also remember that this is a roast so it is best cooked to a medium rare, not well done. To make sure your steak is perfect – I recommend using a thermapen to check internal temperatures.?#&amp;Let rest for 10 minutes under foil, then slice, and enjoy Tri Tip ecstasy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the bison meat with the minced garlic and add the butter a dash of Worcestershire sauce (bison meat is lean so the butter adds fat= moisture). Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the ribs and rub?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the dry rub ingredients together in a small bowl. Rather than specifying the exact amounts, focus on the percentages and make a proportional amount to the number of ribs you are smoking. I don’t like to run short on my rub and have to either skimp or make a second batch so I always err on the side of having some extra.?#&amp;Trim off any excessively large or loose pieces of fat or meat to the ribs. However, be sure to leave a nice even layer of fat on the topside so you end of with a trim and tidy shaped rib. Set all the ribs in a cookie sheet.?#&amp;Score both sides of the ribs in a 1” diamond shape pattern. Since the fat layer isn’t that thick, watch your depth and don’t score it as deep as you would on a brisket.?#&amp;Evenly smoother the yellow mustard on all six sides of each rib.?#&amp;Generously sprinkle the dry rub onto the ribs and work it into the score marks so that all six sides are evenly covered. See photos. Now take a photo and post it to Instagram to make your friends jealous.?#&amp;Cover the ribs with plastic and let the ribs setup in the fridge for at least one hour. Remember to pull them from the fridge and let them come up to temperature before they go onto the smoker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the smoker?#&amp;?#&amp;I used my Big Green Egg, but the overall procedure works on whatever smoker you are using. Always start with a clean smoker and good quality lump charcoal.?#&amp;?#&amp;Load your smoker with enough charcoal to sustain about a 4 hour cook. In the large BGE, this was about just under the &#189; mark to the line.?#&amp;Start a small fire and get the smoker up to 225. Keep a close eye on the size of the fire as it warms up so that the smoker doesn’t get too hot. At this stage it’s much harder to cool the fire down than it is to bump it up a few degrees.?#&amp;Open first beer.?#&amp;Add your wood of choice, which in this case was 2-3 chunks of Hickory.?#&amp;If you are using a BGE, add the plate setter and a water tray with hot (not cold!) water. I use medium size aluminum plans.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now you’re ready to put the ribs on the smoker. You did remember to take them out of the fridge before you started the fire right??#&amp;?#&amp;Smoking the ribs?#&amp;?#&amp;Load the ribs, bone down, fat side up on the grates, leaving about an inch between the ribs.?#&amp;Smoke the ribs at 225 for about two hours until the internal temperature gets to 180-185. I used a Flame Boss so I just dialed in the two probes and let the Flame Boss do the work. If you’re curious what internal temp any protein you’re cooking should reach, be sure to check out our BBQ Calculator!?#&amp;After about 165, occasionally spritz the ribs with Apple juice to keep them moist.?#&amp;While the ribs are smoking, prepare the Texas Crutch/Foil Stage broth. Do this well in advance of the ribs reaching their target temperature so that everything is done ahead of time. Somewhere around beer number 3 is a good time to shoot for.?#&amp;?#&amp;Texas Crutch/Foil Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix all of the broth ingredients together in a saucepan and simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes.If you are using an outdoor burner on your grill, watch the temperature so that it doesn’t get to a boil.?#&amp;Allow the broth to cool to room temperature and set aside covered.?#&amp;Set aside two large pieces of tin foil sized to the number and size of your ribs. Fold the edges up on one of them to make a shallow tray to receive the ribs and broth. &#160;?#&amp;Once the ribs have reached 180-185, place them in the foil tray, and gently, but generously spoon the room temperature (not cold) broth over the ribs.?#&amp;Fold all of the edges up and then cover it with the second piece of foil, overlapping any seams.?#&amp;Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 200-205, about one hour. I bumped up the temperature slightly on the smoker at this point, but you will need to use your own judgement there.?#&amp;?#&amp;Final: Set Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Return the smoker temperature to 225 or lower.?#&amp;Once the Texas Crutch phase is over, return the uncovered </Data></Cell>

Cut it in half so each strip is no longer than 5 inches in length and no longer than 4 inches in width.?#&amp;In large gallon zip lock bags, add the meat and the marinade and let marinate in the fridge overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing from the fridge?#&amp;?#&amp;Double up the skewers so that each piece is hanging from two skewers. The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&amp;Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&amp;On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&amp;Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&amp;Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&amp;**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&amp;After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&amp;Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&amp;Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks. Enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger.

Rather than specifying the exact amounts, focus on the percentages and make a proportional amount to the number of ribs you are smoking. I don’t like to run short on my rub and have to either skimp or make a second batch so I always err on the side of having some extra.?#&amp;Trim off any excessively large or loose pieces of fat or meat to the ribs. However, be sure to leave a nice even layer of fat on the topside so you end of with a trim and tidy shaped rib. Set all the ribs in a cookie sheet.?#&amp;Score both sides of the ribs in a 1” diamond shape pattern. Since the fat layer isn’t that thick, watch your depth and don’t score it as deep as you would on a brisket.?#&amp;Evenly smoother the yellow mustard on all six sides of each rib.?#&amp;Generously sprinkle the dry rub onto the ribs and work it into the score marks so that all six sides are evenly covered. See photos. Now take a photo and post it to Instagram to make your friends jealous.?#&amp;Cover the ribs with plastic and let the ribs setup in the fridge for at least one hour. Remember to pull them from the fridge and let them come up to temperature before they go onto the smoker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the smoker?#&amp;?#&amp;I used my Big Green Egg, but the overall procedure works on whatever smoker you are using. Always start with a clean smoker and good quality lump charcoal.?#&amp;?#&amp;Load your smoker with enough charcoal to sustain about a 4 hour cook. In the large BGE, this was about just under the &#189; mark to the line.?#&amp;Start a small fire and get the smoker up to 225. Keep a close eye on the size of the fire as it warms up so that the smoker doesn’t get too hot. At this stage it’s much harder to cool the fire down than it is to bump it up a few degrees.?#&amp;Open first beer.?#&amp;Add your wood of choice, which in this case was 2-3 chunks of Hickory.?#&amp;If you are using a BGE, add the plate setter and a water tray with hot (not cold!) water. I use medium size aluminum plans.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now you’re ready to put the ribs on the smoker. You did remember to take them out of the fridge before you started the fire right??#&amp;?#&amp;Smoking the ribs?#&amp;?#&amp;Load the ribs, bone down, fat side up on the grates, leaving about an inch between the ribs.?#&amp;Smoke the ribs at 225 for about two hours until the internal temperature gets to 180-185. I used a Flame Boss so I just dialed in the two probes and let the Flame Boss do the work. If you’re curious what internal temp any protein you’re cooking should reach, be sure to check out our BBQ Calculator!?#&amp;After about 165, occasionally spritz the ribs with Apple juice to keep them moist.?#&amp;While the ribs are smoking, prepare the Texas Crutch/Foil Stage broth. Do this well in advance of the ribs reaching their target temperature so that everything is done ahead of time. Somewhere around beer number 3 is a good time to shoot for.?#&amp;?#&amp;Texas Crutch/Foil Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix all of the broth ingredients together in a saucepan and simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes.If you are using an outdoor burner on your grill, watch the temperature so that it doesn’t get to a boil.?#&amp;Allow the broth to cool to room temperature and set aside covered.?#&amp;Set aside two large pieces of tin foil sized to the number and size of your ribs. Fold the edges up on one of them to make a shallow tray to receive the ribs and broth. &#160;?#&amp;Once the ribs have reached 180-185, place them in the foil tray, and gently, but generously spoon the room temperature (not cold) broth over the ribs.?#&amp;Fold all of the edges up and then cover it with the second piece of foil, overlapping any seams.?#&amp;Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 200-205, about one hour. I bumped up the temperature slightly on the smoker at this point, but you will need to use your own judgement there.?#&amp;?#&amp;Final: Set Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Return the smoker temperature to 225 or lower.?#&amp;Once the Texas Crutch phase is over, return the uncovered </Data></Cell>

If using a standard charcoal or gas grill, prepare to cook directly over the flame/heat source.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook the burgers, flipping midway through, until you’ve reached your desired internal temperature. I recommend using an internal read thermometer, like the Thermapen to test internal temps and know when your meat is done. For medium rare, go for 145 degrees, medium is 160 degrees. While grilling the burgers, grill the peppers until they have developed char marks on both sides.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the burgers and peppers and let them rest for a few minutes.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Overview?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the meat overnight, or for a minimum of 8 hours for maximum flavor. On the grill, the meat is going to hang on skewers to be as far away from the flame as possible and then transition to the grates at the end to ensure all pieces are fully dehydrated over the course of the cook.?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all the ingredients for the marinade, then pulse with a stick blender/immersion blender to fully mix all ingredients together and chop the fresh garlic.?#&amp;Slice the meat into 1/4” slices, removing all fat. Cut it in half so each strip is no longer than 5 inches in length and no longer than 4 inches in width.?#&amp;In large gallon zip lock bags, add the meat and the marinade and let marinate in the fridge overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing from the fridge?#&amp;?#&amp;Double up the skewers so that each piece is hanging from two skewers. The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&amp;Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&amp;On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&amp;Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&amp;Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&amp;**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&amp;After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&amp;Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&amp;Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks. Enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices.

If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the ribs and rub?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the dry rub ingredients together in a small bowl. Rather than specifying the exact amounts, focus on the percentages and make a proportional amount to the number of ribs you are smoking. I don’t like to run short on my rub and have to either skimp or make a second batch so I always err on the side of having some extra.?#&amp;Trim off any excessively large or loose pieces of fat or meat to the ribs. However, be sure to leave a nice even layer of fat on the topside so you end of with a trim and tidy shaped rib. Set all the ribs in a cookie sheet.?#&amp;Score both sides of the ribs in a 1” diamond shape pattern. Since the fat layer isn’t that thick, watch your depth and don’t score it as deep as you would on a brisket.?#&amp;Evenly smoother the yellow mustard on all six sides of each rib.?#&amp;Generously sprinkle the dry rub onto the ribs and work it into the score marks so that all six sides are evenly covered. See photos. Now take a photo and post it to Instagram to make your friends jealous.?#&amp;Cover the ribs with plastic and let the ribs setup in the fridge for at least one hour. Remember to pull them from the fridge and let them come up to temperature before they go onto the smoker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the smoker?#&amp;?#&amp;I used my Big Green Egg, but the overall procedure works on whatever smoker you are using. Always start with a clean smoker and good quality lump charcoal.?#&amp;?#&amp;Load your smoker with enough charcoal to sustain about a 4 hour cook. In the large BGE, this was about just under the &#189; mark to the line.?#&amp;Start a small fire and get the smoker up to 225. Keep a close eye on the size of the fire as it warms up so that the smoker doesn’t get too hot. At this stage it’s much harder to cool the fire down than it is to bump it up a few degrees.?#&amp;Open first beer.?#&amp;Add your wood of choice, which in this case was 2-3 chunks of Hickory.?#&amp;If you are using a BGE, add the plate setter and a water tray with hot (not cold!) water. I use medium size aluminum plans.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now you’re ready to put the ribs on the smoker. You did remember to take them out of the fridge before you started the fire right??#&amp;?#&amp;Smoking the ribs?#&amp;?#&amp;Load the ribs, bone down, fat side up on the grates, leaving about an inch between the ribs.?#&amp;Smoke the ribs at 225 for about two hours until the internal temperature gets to 180-185. I used a Flame Boss so I just dialed in the two probes and let the Flame Boss do the work. If you’re curious what internal temp any protein you’re cooking should reach, be sure to check out our BBQ Calculator!?#&amp;After about 165, occasionally spritz the ribs with Apple juice to keep them moist.?#&amp;While the ribs are smoking, prepare the Texas Crutch/Foil Stage broth. Do this well in advance of the ribs reaching their target temperature so that everything is done ahead of time. Somewhere around beer number 3 is a good time to shoot for.?#&amp;?#&amp;Texas Crutch/Foil Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix all of the broth ingredients together in a saucepan and simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes.If you are using an outdoor burner on your grill, watch the temperature so that it doesn’t get to a boil.?#&amp;Allow the broth to cool to room temperature and set aside covered.?#&amp;Set aside two large pieces of tin foil sized to the number and size of your ribs. Fold the edges up on one of them to make a shallow tray to receive the ribs and broth. &#160;?#&amp;Once the ribs have reached 180-185, place them in the foil tray, and gently, but generously spoon the room temperature (not cold) broth over the ribs.?#&amp;Fold all of the edges up and then cover it with the second piece of foil, overlapping any seams.?#&amp;Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 200-205, about one hour. I bumped up the temperature slightly on the smoker at this point, but you will need to use your own judgement there.?#&amp;?#&amp;Final: Set Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Return the smoker temperature to 225 or lower.?#&amp;Once the Texas Crutch phase is over, return the uncovered </Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Overview?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the meat overnight, or for a minimum of 8 hours for maximum flavor. On the grill, the meat is going to hang on skewers to be as far away from the flame as possible and then transition to the grates at the end to ensure all pieces are fully dehydrated over the course of the cook.?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all the ingredients for the marinade, then pulse with a stick blender/immersion blender to fully mix all ingredients together and chop the fresh garlic.?#&amp;Slice the meat into 1/4” slices, removing all fat. Cut it in half so each strip is no longer than 5 inches in length and no longer than 4 inches in width.?#&amp;In large gallon zip lock bags, add the meat and the marinade and let marinate in the fridge overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing from the fridge?#&amp;?#&amp;Double up the skewers so that each piece is hanging from two skewers. The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&amp;Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&amp;On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&amp;Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&amp;Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&amp;**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&amp;After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&amp;Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&amp;Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks. Enjoy!</Data></Cell>

I don’t like to run short on my rub and have to either skimp or make a second batch so I always err on the side of having some extra.?#&amp;Trim off any excessively large or loose pieces of fat or meat to the ribs. However, be sure to leave a nice even layer of fat on the topside so you end of with a trim and tidy shaped rib. Set all the ribs in a cookie sheet.?#&amp;Score both sides of the ribs in a 1” diamond shape pattern. Since the fat layer isn’t that thick, watch your depth and don’t score it as deep as you would on a brisket.?#&amp;Evenly smoother the yellow mustard on all six sides of each rib.?#&amp;Generously sprinkle the dry rub onto the ribs and work it into the score marks so that all six sides are evenly covered. See photos. Now take a photo and post it to Instagram to make your friends jealous.?#&amp;Cover the ribs with plastic and let the ribs setup in the fridge for at least one hour. Remember to pull them from the fridge and let them come up to temperature before they go onto the smoker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the smoker?#&amp;?#&amp;I used my Big Green Egg, but the overall procedure works on whatever smoker you are using. Always start with a clean smoker and good quality lump charcoal.?#&amp;?#&amp;Load your smoker with enough charcoal to sustain about a 4 hour cook. In the large BGE, this was about just under the &#189; mark to the line.?#&amp;Start a small fire and get the smoker up to 225. Keep a close eye on the size of the fire as it warms up so that the smoker doesn’t get too hot. At this stage it’s much harder to cool the fire down than it is to bump it up a few degrees.?#&amp;Open first beer.?#&amp;Add your wood of choice, which in this case was 2-3 chunks of Hickory.?#&amp;If you are using a BGE, add the plate setter and a water tray with hot (not cold!) water. I use medium size aluminum plans.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now you’re ready to put the ribs on the smoker. You did remember to take them out of the fridge before you started the fire right??#&amp;?#&amp;Smoking the ribs?#&amp;?#&amp;Load the ribs, bone down, fat side up on the grates, leaving about an inch between the ribs.?#&amp;Smoke the ribs at 225 for about two hours until the internal temperature gets to 180-185. I used a Flame Boss so I just dialed in the two probes and let the Flame Boss do the work. If you’re curious what internal temp any protein you’re cooking should reach, be sure to check out our BBQ Calculator!?#&amp;After about 165, occasionally spritz the ribs with Apple juice to keep them moist.?#&amp;While the ribs are smoking, prepare the Texas Crutch/Foil Stage broth. Do this well in advance of the ribs reaching their target temperature so that everything is done ahead of time. Somewhere around beer number 3 is a good time to shoot for.?#&amp;?#&amp;Texas Crutch/Foil Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix all of the broth ingredients together in a saucepan and simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes.If you are using an outdoor burner on your grill, watch the temperature so that it doesn’t get to a boil.?#&amp;Allow the broth to cool to room temperature and set aside covered.?#&amp;Set aside two large pieces of tin foil sized to the number and size of your ribs. Fold the edges up on one of them to make a shallow tray to receive the ribs and broth. &#160;?#&amp;Once the ribs have reached 180-185, place them in the foil tray, and gently, but generously spoon the room temperature (not cold) broth over the ribs.?#&amp;Fold all of the edges up and then cover it with the second piece of foil, overlapping any seams.?#&amp;Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 200-205, about one hour. I bumped up the temperature slightly on the smoker at this point, but you will need to use your own judgement there.?#&amp;?#&amp;Final: Set Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Return the smoker temperature to 225 or lower.?#&amp;Once the Texas Crutch phase is over, return the uncovered </Data></Cell>

Don’t overdo the sauce; use just enough to coat the bologna. Put the bologna back on the PBC and cook for 10-15 minutes. Just enough to set the glaze.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove and loosely cover the bologna with aluminum foil while you prep for your bologna sandwich. Take two pieces of Wonder Texas Toast, lie them on the grate and cook with the lid off until you see some grill marks.&#160; Slice the bologna to your desired thickness and then put mayonnaise, tomato, sliced onion and lettuce on your sandwich and enjoy.</Data></Cell>

Cut it in half so each strip is no longer than 5 inches in length and no longer than 4 inches in width.?#&amp;In large gallon zip lock bags, add the meat and the marinade and let marinate in the fridge overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing from the fridge?#&amp;?#&amp;Double up the skewers so that each piece is hanging from two skewers. The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&amp;Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&amp;On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&amp;Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&amp;Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&amp;**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&amp;After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&amp;Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&amp;Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks. Enjoy!</Data></Cell>

I don’t like to run short on my rub and have to either skimp or make a second batch so I always err on the side of having some extra.?#&amp;Trim off any excessively large or loose pieces of fat or meat to the ribs. However, be sure to leave a nice even layer of fat on the topside so you end of with a trim and tidy shaped rib. Set all the ribs in a cookie sheet.?#&amp;Score both sides of the ribs in a 1” diamond shape pattern.

See photos. Now take a photo and post it to Instagram to make your friends jealous.?#&amp;Cover the ribs with plastic and let the ribs setup in the fridge for at least one hour. Remember to pull them from the fridge and let them come up to temperature before they go onto the smoker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the smoker?#&amp;?#&amp;I used my Big Green Egg, but the overall procedure works on whatever smoker you are using. Always start with a clean smoker and good quality lump charcoal.?#&amp;?#&amp;Load your smoker with enough charcoal to sustain about a 4 hour cook. In the large BGE, this was about just under the &#189; mark to the line.?#&amp;Start a small fire and get the smoker up to 225. Keep a close eye on the size of the fire as it warms up so that the smoker doesn’t get too hot. At this stage it’s much harder to cool the fire down than it is to bump it up a few degrees.?#&amp;Open first beer.?#&amp;Add your wood of choice, which in this case was 2-3 chunks of Hickory.?#&amp;If you are using a BGE, add the plate setter and a water tray with hot (not cold!) water. I use medium size aluminum plans.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now you’re ready to put the ribs on the smoker. You did remember to take them out of the fridge before you started the fire right??#&amp;?#&amp;Smoking the ribs?#&amp;?#&amp;Load the ribs, bone down, fat side up on the grates, leaving about an inch between the ribs.?#&amp;Smoke the ribs at 225 for about two hours until the internal temperature gets to 180-185. I used a Flame Boss so I just dialed in the two probes and let the Flame Boss do the work. If you’re curious what internal temp any protein you’re cooking should reach, be sure to check out our BBQ Calculator!?#&amp;After about 165, occasionally spritz the ribs with Apple juice to keep them moist.?#&amp;While the ribs are smoking, prepare the Texas Crutch/Foil Stage broth. Do this well in advance of the ribs reaching their target temperature so that everything is done ahead of time. Somewhere around beer number 3 is a good time to shoot for.?#&amp;?#&amp;Texas Crutch/Foil Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix all of the broth ingredients together in a saucepan and simmer on low heat for 20-30 minutes.If you are using an outdoor burner on your grill, watch the temperature so that it doesn’t get to a boil.?#&amp;Allow the broth to cool to room temperature and set aside covered.?#&amp;Set aside two large pieces of tin foil sized to the number and size of your ribs. Fold the edges up on one of them to make a shallow tray to receive the ribs and broth. &#160;?#&amp;Once the ribs have reached 180-185, place them in the foil tray, and gently, but generously spoon the room temperature (not cold) broth over the ribs.?#&amp;Fold all of the edges up and then cover it with the second piece of foil, overlapping any seams.?#&amp;Return the wrapped ribs to the smoker until the internal temperature reaches 200-205, about one hour. I bumped up the temperature slightly on the smoker at this point, but you will need to use your own judgement there.?#&amp;?#&amp;Final: Set Stage?#&amp;?#&amp;Return the smoker temperature to 225 or lower.?#&amp;Once the Texas Crutch phase is over, return the uncovered </Data></Cell>

(See notes below for a fantastic all-purpose brine recipe.)?#&amp;In a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, herbs, salt, pepper, and lemon juice with an immersion blender.?#&amp;Next, lay the turkey out on a big cutting board or plate and spread it out. Slide your fingers under the skin and separate it from the meat for placement of butter. Slather butter underneath the breast, legs, etc- anywhere you can get butter underneath the skin- this is what is going to keep it moist (this is the least fun part but the results are worth it!).?#&amp;Heat your grill to 350 degrees, creating a direct and indirect zone. Grill the turkey on the indirect side, flipping halfway through, until an internal read thermometer reads a 160 degrees internal temp in the breast. This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily. This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Rinse the veggies before slicing. Using a mandolin, slice the turnips and delicate squash with the largest slice setting on a mandolin- about 1/4″ thick. It is important to use a mandolin so that the veggies are sliced thinly and uniformly.?#&amp;Set your pellet smoker for 350 degrees, smoking setting. Ie, vents are set for maximum ventilation.?#&amp;Line a 12″ X 18” sheet pan with parchment or foil (parchment is better for the environment).?#&amp;Arrange the chicken on one side of the pan, and then lay out the squash and turnips. Sprinkle the chicken with the smoked paprika.?#&amp;Sprinkle all ingredients with the salt and pepper and thyme. Drizzle the squash with the maple syrup.?#&amp;Smoke the sheet pan dinner at 350 degrees, for 30 minutes, or until the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 170 degrees. I recommend using a Thermapen internal read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve immediately- easy peasy! The beauty of this recipe is that it combines the simplicity of the “sheet pan dinner” with the great flavor and ease of use of the Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker. If you can make it in your oven, you can easily make it in your pellet smoker!!?#&amp;?#&amp;Note: This recipe was produced in partnership with Green Mountain Grills.

(See notes below for a fantastic all-purpose brine recipe.)?#&amp;In a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, herbs, salt, pepper, and lemon juice with an immersion blender.?#&amp;Next, lay the turkey out on a big cutting board or plate and spread it out. Slide your fingers under the skin and separate it from the meat for placement of butter. Slather butter underneath the breast, legs, etc- anywhere you can get butter underneath the skin- this is what is going to keep it moist (this is the least fun part but the results are worth it!).?#&amp;Heat your grill to 350 degrees, creating a direct and indirect zone. Grill the turkey on the indirect side, flipping halfway through, until an internal read thermometer reads a 160 degrees internal temp in the breast. This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily.

Ie, vents are set for maximum ventilation.?#&amp;Line a 12″ X 18” sheet pan with parchment or foil (parchment is better for the environment).?#&amp;Arrange the chicken on one side of the pan, and then lay out the squash and turnips.

I recommend using a Thermapen internal read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve immediately- easy peasy! The beauty of this recipe is that it combines the simplicity of the “sheet pan dinner” with the great flavor and ease of use of the Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker.

(See notes below for a fantastic all-purpose brine recipe.)?#&amp;In a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, herbs, salt, pepper, and lemon juice with an immersion blender.?#&amp;Next, lay the turkey out on a big cutting board or plate and spread it out. Slide your fingers under the skin and separate it from the meat for placement of butter. Slather butter underneath the breast, legs, etc- anywhere you can get butter underneath the skin- this is what is going to keep it moist (this is the least fun part but the results are worth it!).?#&amp;Heat your grill to 350 degrees, creating a direct and indirect zone. Grill the turkey on the indirect side, flipping halfway through, until an internal read thermometer reads a 160 degrees internal temp in the breast. This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily. This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Rinse the veggies before slicing. Using a mandolin, slice the turnips and delicate squash with the largest slice setting on a mandolin- about 1/4″ thick. It is important to use a mandolin so that the veggies are sliced thinly and uniformly.?#&amp;Set your pellet smoker for 350 degrees, smoking setting. Ie, vents are set for maximum ventilation.?#&amp;Line a 12″ X 18” sheet pan with parchment or foil (parchment is better for the environment).?#&amp;Arrange the chicken on one side of the pan, and then lay out the squash and turnips. Sprinkle the chicken with the smoked paprika.?#&amp;Sprinkle all ingredients with the salt and pepper and thyme. Drizzle the squash with the maple syrup.?#&amp;Smoke the sheet pan dinner at 350 degrees, for 30 minutes, or until the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 170 degrees. I recommend using a Thermapen internal read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve immediately- easy peasy! The beauty of this recipe is that it combines the simplicity of the “sheet pan dinner” with the great flavor and ease of use of the Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker. If you can make it in your oven, you can easily make it in your pellet smoker!!?#&amp;?#&amp;Note: This recipe was produced in partnership with Green Mountain Grills.

Slide your fingers under the skin and separate it from the meat for placement of butter. Slather butter underneath the breast, legs, etc- anywhere you can get butter underneath the skin- this is what is going to keep it moist (this is the least fun part but the results are worth it!).?#&amp;Heat your grill to 350 degrees, creating a direct and indirect zone. Grill the turkey on the indirect side, flipping halfway through, until an internal read thermometer reads a 160 degrees internal temp in the breast. This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily. This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Rinse the veggies before slicing. Using a mandolin, slice the turnips and delicate squash with the largest slice setting on a mandolin- about 1/4″ thick. It is important to use a mandolin so that the veggies are sliced thinly and uniformly.?#&amp;Set your pellet smoker for 350 degrees, smoking setting. Ie, vents are set for maximum ventilation.?#&amp;Line a 12″ X 18” sheet pan with parchment or foil (parchment is better for the environment).?#&amp;Arrange the chicken on one side of the pan, and then lay out the squash and turnips. Sprinkle the chicken with the smoked paprika.?#&amp;Sprinkle all ingredients with the salt and pepper and thyme. Drizzle the squash with the maple syrup.?#&amp;Smoke the sheet pan dinner at 350 degrees, for 30 minutes, or until the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 170 degrees. I recommend using a Thermapen internal read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve immediately- easy peasy! The beauty of this recipe is that it combines the simplicity of the “sheet pan dinner” with the great flavor and ease of use of the Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker. If you can make it in your oven, you can easily make it in your pellet smoker!!?#&amp;?#&amp;Note: This recipe was produced in partnership with Green Mountain Grills.

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper.

Once the pulpo is cooled down cut it up into about 1 – 2 inch sizes. Keep the size consistent so they grill evenly. &#160;Skewer the pulpo and brush with a little bit of olive oil. Grill them on direct heat for just a minute or two per side.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the first 6 ingredients (shallots, ginger, soy, lime juice and sugar) in a blender and liquefy until all ingredients are mixed up. Next, add the oil and green onion and blend again until uniformly mixed. Add black pepper to your liking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, devein and butterfly these large prawns so they will grill evenly being careful to remove the waste vein. (When purchasing shrimp, it’s a bonus if you can find them deveined already and there is no&#160;need to butterfly) You will grill these prawns much like lobster in that they will need to be butterflied on both sides to grill evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the prawns or shrimp for 30 minutes at room temp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium high direct heat (about 350-375 degrees). Make sure to oil your grill grates so the prawns will not stick! Grill the prawns about 6-8 minutes per side or until they begin to form nice charm marks. Use your thermapen to ensure your prawns have reached an internal temp of 145 degrees and pull them off.?#&amp;?#&amp;I paired these with Asian Slaw and Coconut Rice, both of which I made beforehand so I could spend more time with my dinner guests when they came over. Plus, slaw is always better when it has time to marinate.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Get out one medium bowl for mixing the liquids and one large serving bowl for the slaw. Combine the rice vinegar, sesame oil, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger and garlic with a whisk until uniform in consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the larger bowl, combine the slaw mix, red bell pepper, green onions and cilantro. Toss the liquid ingredients into the cabbage mix and combine. Let marinate in the fridge at least an hour before serving.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Before embarking on making this rice dish, you will need to refrigerate the 2 cans of coconut milk in the fridge an hour before preparing. This is to make it easy to scoop the thick coconut “cream” off the top to use for this recipe. The remaining coconut milk/water can be used in other recipes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the rice, the 1.5 cups coconut cream, sugar, salt and water in a saucepan. Stir briefly to combine the sugar, rice and coconut cream. Bring to a boil, then cover and let simmer on low heat for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the burner and fluff the rice with a fork, let it sit covered for another 20 minutes to continue to steam.?#&amp;?#&amp;This rice will knock your socks off!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the first 6 ingredients (shallots, ginger, soy, lime juice and sugar) in a blender and liquefy until all ingredients are mixed up. Next, add the oil and green onion and blend again until uniformly mixed. Add black pepper to your liking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, devein and butterfly these large prawns so they will grill evenly being careful to remove the waste vein. (When purchasing shrimp, it’s a bonus if you can find them deveined already and there is no&#160;need to butterfly) You will grill these prawns much like lobster in that they will need to be butterflied on both sides to grill evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the prawns or shrimp for 30 minutes at room temp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium high direct heat (about 350-375 degrees). Make sure to oil your grill grates so the prawns will not stick! Grill the prawns about 6-8 minutes per side or until they begin to form nice charm marks. Use your thermapen to ensure your prawns have reached an internal temp of 145 degrees and pull them off.?#&amp;?#&amp;I paired these with Asian Slaw and Coconut Rice, both of which I made beforehand so I could spend more time with my dinner guests when they came over. Plus, slaw is always better when it has time to marinate.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Get out one medium bowl for mixing the liquids and one large serving bowl for the slaw. Combine the rice vinegar, sesame oil, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger and garlic with a whisk until uniform in consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the larger bowl, combine the slaw mix, red bell pepper, green onions and cilantro. Toss the liquid ingredients into the cabbage mix and combine. Let marinate in the fridge at least an hour before serving.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Before embarking on making this rice dish, you will need to refrigerate the 2 cans of coconut milk in the fridge an hour before preparing. This is to make it easy to scoop the thick coconut “cream” off the top to use for this recipe. The remaining coconut milk/water can be used in other recipes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the rice, the 1.5 cups coconut cream, sugar, salt and water in a saucepan. Stir briefly to combine the sugar, rice and coconut cream. Bring to a boil, then cover and let simmer on low heat for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the burner and fluff the rice with a fork, let it sit covered for another 20 minutes to continue to steam.?#&amp;?#&amp;This rice will knock your socks off!</Data></Cell>

All remaining lime juice and minced garlic pour over the top of the fish. &#160;Place the fish on top of parchment paper that’s been slightly brushed with oil. Grill in indirect heat for about 15 – 20 minutes, turn the fish mid way into cooking. The last 3-5&#160;minutes of cooking time place the fish on direct heat &#160;– to crisp up the skin. Once the tempature reaches&#160;135 F remove it and let it rest for a few minutes before serving it.</Data></Cell>

Season both sides of the snapper with the salt, pepper and oil, don’t forget to season the inside as well. Stuff the cavity with the cilantro, crushed garlic and lime juice as well as a few slices of limes {keep the rest to garnish}. All remaining lime juice and minced garlic pour over the top of the fish. &#160;Place the fish on top of parchment paper that’s been slightly brushed with oil. Grill in indirect heat for about 15 – 20 minutes, turn the fish mid way into cooking. The last 3-5&#160;minutes of cooking time place the fish on direct heat &#160;– to crisp up the skin. Once the tempature reaches&#160;135 F remove it and let it rest for a few minutes before serving it.</Data></Cell>

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper.

Next, add the oil and green onion and blend again until uniformly mixed. Add black pepper to your liking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, devein and butterfly these large prawns so they will grill evenly being careful to remove the waste vein. (When purchasing shrimp, it’s a bonus if you can find them deveined already and there is no&#160;need to butterfly) You will grill these prawns much like lobster in that they will need to be butterflied on both sides to grill evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the prawns or shrimp for 30 minutes at room temp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium high direct heat (about 350-375 degrees). Make sure to oil your grill grates so the prawns will not stick! Grill the prawns about 6-8 minutes per side or until they begin to form nice charm marks. Use your thermapen to ensure your prawns have reached an internal temp of 145 degrees and pull them off.?#&amp;?#&amp;I paired these with Asian Slaw and Coconut Rice, both of which I made beforehand so I could spend more time with my dinner guests when they came over. Plus, slaw is always better when it has time to marinate.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Get out one medium bowl for mixing the liquids and one large serving bowl for the slaw.

Toss the liquid ingredients into the cabbage mix and combine. Let marinate in the fridge at least an hour before serving.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Before embarking on making this rice dish, you will need to refrigerate the 2 cans of coconut milk in the fridge an hour before preparing. This is to make it easy to scoop the thick coconut “cream” off the top to use for this recipe. The remaining coconut milk/water can be used in other recipes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the rice, the 1.5 cups coconut cream, sugar, salt and water in a saucepan. Stir briefly to combine the sugar, rice and coconut cream. Bring to a boil, then cover and let simmer on low heat for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the burner and fluff the rice with a fork, let it sit covered for another 20 minutes to continue to steam.?#&amp;?#&amp;This rice will knock your socks off!</Data></Cell>

Apply the rub and smoke the meat for 2 hours.?#&amp;After 2 hours, remove from the smoker and do the “Texas Crutch,” i.e., “wrap in foil”. Mix the apple juice and pineapple preserve and add to the foil packet. Let smoke another two hours.?#&amp;Meanwhile, as the meat is smoking make your rum barbecue sauce. Combine the BBQ sauce, pineapple preserves, rum, chopped pineapple, pineapple juice and allspice. Let reduce down for 20 minutes on medium simmer.?#&amp;During the last hour, remove the ribs from foil and glaze with the pineapple rum BBQ sauce.?#&amp;Layer slices of pineapple on top of the ribs and drizzle more sauce over the pineapple.?#&amp;Let smoke for an additional hour to let the sauce set.

While the grill is heating up, go ahead and mix your gorgonzola, walnuts, cherries and thyme.?#&amp;?#&amp;Take a very sharp knife and cut a slit into the pork chops where the stuffing will go, using your finger to expand the opening. Stuff the pork chops with the cheese mixture and use a tooth pick to secure the opening so the stuffing doesn’t come out while grilling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, cut your apples. Combine the maple syrup and bourbon together in a cup. Sprinkle the apples with the cinnamon and then drizzle the maple bourbon syrup on top of the apples.?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grates with a high heat oil like avocado oil or vegetable oil so your food doesn’t stick to the grill grates. Grill the pork chops on direct heat, flipping halfway through, until the internal temp reaches 140 degrees with an internal read thermometer, this should take about 5-8 minutes depending on your grill. While grilling the pork chops, add the apple slices and let them grill until they develop char marks and have begun to caramelize on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the pork chops have reached an internal temp of 140 degrees, pull them off the grill (they will continue to cook and reach 145 degrees after removed from the grill). Let them rest under foil for 5 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the pork chops with the grilled apples for sweet-salty pork pairing perfection!?#&amp;?#&amp;What is your favorite way to enjoy Pork Chops?

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;In a bowl, add olive oil, old bay and the shrimp and toss to coat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Meanwhile, start your grits: Heat quart of chicken broth and water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes stirring constantly (grits will clump easily-also easily stick to bottom of pot!). Let the grits cook down on a medium simmer, stirring often,&#160;about 30 minutes.&#160; While the grits are cooking,&#160;prepare your grill for cooking on direct heat. I recommend using your charcoal grill with Kingsford Charcoal to get smoky flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;While your charcoal is heating up, continue to watch and stir your grits. Once they have reduced down, keep them on a very low simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the shrimp, sausage and peppers until cooked through. The shrimp will cook most quickly- remove them as soon as they begin to turn pink. Remove the sausage once an internal temp of 145 degrees with a Thermapen has been reached and the peppers can be removed once they have developed char marks.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the shrimp, peppers and sausage have cooked on the grill, remove them and set aside on a cutting board to let cool slightly so they can be chopped. Meanwhile, add the milk, cheese and butter to the grits and stir to combine and let thicken over a low simmer. Add salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to the grits. &#160;Chop the peppers and sausage and remove the tails off the shrimp. Ladle grits &#189; cup at a time into bowls. Add shrimp, peppers and sausage and garnish with chopped parsley.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with&#160;your favorite hot sauce, and additional salt and pepper. I hope you and your family enjoy this Southern inspired dish as much as mine does! Cheers!</Data></Cell>

Oil the grate so the meat will not stick. Place the meat on its side on the grate. Add your preferred wood for smoke- I added cherry wood. Cook until you reach an internal temperature of 140 degrees as measured with an internal read thermometer (I recommend the Thermapen for accurate internal temperature readings). This should take approximately 2 &#189; hrs depending on the weather conditions.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the bologna from the grate. Glaze with the BBQ glaze. Don’t overdo the sauce; use just enough to coat the bologna. Put the bologna back on the PBC and cook for 10-15 minutes.

Take two pieces of Wonder Texas Toast, lie them on the grate and cook with the lid off until you see some grill marks.&#160; Slice the bologna to your desired thickness and then put mayonnaise, tomato, sliced onion and lettuce on your sandwich and enjoy.</Data></Cell>

Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half.

Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin.

Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes stirring constantly (grits will clump easily-also easily stick to bottom of pot!). Let the grits cook down on a medium simmer, stirring often,&#160;about 30 minutes.&#160; While the grits are cooking,&#160;prepare your grill for cooking on direct heat. I recommend using your charcoal grill with Kingsford Charcoal to get smoky flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;While your charcoal is heating up, continue to watch and stir your grits. Once they have reduced down, keep them on a very low simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the shrimp, sausage and peppers until cooked through. The shrimp will cook most quickly- remove them as soon as they begin to turn pink. Remove the sausage once an internal temp of 145 degrees with a Thermapen has been reached and the peppers can be removed once they have developed char marks.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the shrimp, peppers and sausage have cooked on the grill, remove them and set aside on a cutting board to let cool slightly so they can be chopped. Meanwhile, add the milk, cheese and butter to the grits and stir to combine and let thicken over a low simmer. Add salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to the grits. &#160;Chop the peppers and sausage and remove the tails off the shrimp. Ladle grits &#189; cup at a time into bowls. Add shrimp, peppers and sausage and garnish with chopped parsley.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with&#160;your favorite hot sauce, and additional salt and pepper.

This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half. Get all your other ingredients ready to take outside- I usually put everything on a big cutting board and carry it outside and then get another plate for switching out.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the grill is heated up, place the cast iron on one half of the grill and add the bacon and let it reduce. Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

Now, assemble your sliders with the tenderloin, pineapple and peppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;The sweetness of the pineapple and peppers in this recipe really compliment the spice of the Black Pepper marinated pork tenderloin, don’t be surprised that you’ll go back for seconds or thirds!?#&amp;?#&amp;What are your favorite recipes for getting dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes?

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes stirring constantly (grits will clump easily-also easily stick to bottom of pot!). Let the grits cook down on a medium simmer, stirring often,&#160;about 30 minutes.&#160; While the grits are cooking,&#160;prepare your grill for cooking on direct heat. I recommend using your charcoal grill with Kingsford Charcoal to get smoky flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;While your charcoal is heating up, continue to watch and stir your grits. Once they have reduced down, keep them on a very low simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the shrimp, sausage and peppers until cooked through. The shrimp will cook most quickly- remove them as soon as they begin to turn pink. Remove the sausage once an internal temp of 145 degrees with a Thermapen has been reached and the peppers can be removed once they have developed char marks.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the shrimp, peppers and sausage have cooked on the grill, remove them and set aside on a cutting board to let cool slightly so they can be chopped. Meanwhile, add the milk, cheese and butter to the grits and stir to combine and let thicken over a low simmer. Add salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to the grits. &#160;Chop the peppers and sausage and remove the tails off the shrimp. Ladle grits &#189; cup at a time into bowls. Add shrimp, peppers and sausage and garnish with chopped parsley.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with&#160;your favorite hot sauce, and additional salt and pepper.

This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half.

Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes stirring constantly (grits will clump easily-also easily stick to bottom of pot!). Let the grits cook down on a medium simmer, stirring often,&#160;about 30 minutes.&#160; While the grits are cooking,&#160;prepare your grill for cooking on direct heat. I recommend using your charcoal grill with Kingsford Charcoal to get smoky flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;While your charcoal is heating up, continue to watch and stir your grits. Once they have reduced down, keep them on a very low simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the shrimp, sausage and peppers until cooked through. The shrimp will cook most quickly- remove them as soon as they begin to turn pink. Remove the sausage once an internal temp of 145 degrees with a Thermapen has been reached and the peppers can be removed once they have developed char marks.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the shrimp, peppers and sausage have cooked on the grill, remove them and set aside on a cutting board to let cool slightly so they can be chopped. Meanwhile, add the milk, cheese and butter to the grits and stir to combine and let thicken over a low simmer. Add salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to the grits. &#160;Chop the peppers and sausage and remove the tails off the shrimp. Ladle grits &#189; cup at a time into bowls. Add shrimp, peppers and sausage and garnish with chopped parsley.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with&#160;your favorite hot sauce, and additional salt and pepper.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat your grill up, preparing it for medium direct cooking- at a temperature of approximately 350 degrees. This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half. Get all your other ingredients ready to take outside- I usually put everything on a big cutting board and carry it outside and then get another plate for switching out.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the grill is heated up, place the cast iron on one half of the grill and add the bacon and let it reduce. Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes stirring constantly (grits will clump easily-also easily stick to bottom of pot!). Let the grits cook down on a medium simmer, stirring often,&#160;about 30 minutes.&#160; While the grits are cooking,&#160;prepare your grill for cooking on direct heat. I recommend using your charcoal grill with Kingsford Charcoal to get smoky flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;While your charcoal is heating up, continue to watch and stir your grits. Once they have reduced down, keep them on a very low simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the shrimp, sausage and peppers until cooked through. The shrimp will cook most quickly- remove them as soon as they begin to turn pink. Remove the sausage once an internal temp of 145 degrees with a Thermapen has been reached and the peppers can be removed once they have developed char marks.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the shrimp, peppers and sausage have cooked on the grill, remove them and set aside on a cutting board to let cool slightly so they can be chopped. Meanwhile, add the milk, cheese and butter to the grits and stir to combine and let thicken over a low simmer. Add salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to the grits. &#160;Chop the peppers and sausage and remove the tails off the shrimp. Ladle grits &#189; cup at a time into bowls. Add shrimp, peppers and sausage and garnish with chopped parsley.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with&#160;your favorite hot sauce, and additional salt and pepper. I hope you and your family enjoy this Southern inspired dish as much as mine does! Cheers!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove exterior wrapper from the chubb of bologna. Take the chubb and lay it on its side. Take a paring knife and score diagonally about &#188;” to 1/2”&#160; deep in a criss cross method. This will give the meat some texture. Apply approximately 2 TBSP of mustard (amount depends on the size of your chubb) and massage into the meat.&#160; Season with a moderate dusting of Beef &amp; Game Pit Rub to all sides of the bologna.?#&amp;?#&amp;Light your Pit Barrel Cooker (PBC) according to the instructions. Oil the grate so the meat will not stick. Place the meat on its side on the grate. Add your preferred wood for smoke- I added cherry wood. Cook until you reach an internal temperature of 140 degrees as measured with an internal read thermometer (I recommend the Thermapen for accurate internal temperature readings). This should take approximately 2 &#189; hrs depending on the weather conditions.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the bologna from the grate. Glaze with the BBQ glaze. Don’t overdo the sauce; use just enough to coat the bologna. Put the bologna back on the PBC and cook for 10-15 minutes. Just enough to set the glaze.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove and loosely cover the bologna with aluminum foil while you prep for your bologna sandwich. Take two pieces of Wonder Texas Toast, lie them on the grate and cook with the lid off until you see some grill marks.&#160; Slice the bologna to your desired thickness and then put mayonnaise, tomato, sliced onion and lettuce on your sandwich and enjoy.</Data></Cell>

This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half. Get all your other ingredients ready to take outside- I usually put everything on a big cutting board and carry it outside and then get another plate for switching out.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the grill is heated up, place the cast iron on one half of the grill and add the bacon and let it reduce. Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes stirring constantly (grits will clump easily-also easily stick to bottom of pot!). Let the grits cook down on a medium simmer, stirring often,&#160;about 30 minutes.&#160; While the grits are cooking,&#160;prepare your grill for cooking on direct heat. I recommend using your charcoal grill with Kingsford Charcoal to get smoky flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;While your charcoal is heating up, continue to watch and stir your grits. Once they have reduced down, keep them on a very low simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the shrimp, sausage and peppers until cooked through. The shrimp will cook most quickly- remove them as soon as they begin to turn pink. Remove the sausage once an internal temp of 145 degrees with a Thermapen has been reached and the peppers can be removed once they have developed char marks.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the shrimp, peppers and sausage have cooked on the grill, remove them and set aside on a cutting board to let cool slightly so they can be chopped. Meanwhile, add the milk, cheese and butter to the grits and stir to combine and let thicken over a low simmer. Add salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to the grits. &#160;Chop the peppers and sausage and remove the tails off the shrimp. Ladle grits &#189; cup at a time into bowls. Add shrimp, peppers and sausage and garnish with chopped parsley.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with&#160;your favorite hot sauce, and additional salt and pepper. I hope you and your family enjoy this Southern inspired dish as much as mine does! Cheers!</Data></Cell>

Take a paring knife and score diagonally about &#188;” to 1/2”&#160; deep in a criss cross method. This will give the meat some texture. Apply approximately 2 TBSP of mustard (amount depends on the size of your chubb) and massage into the meat.&#160; Season with a moderate dusting of Beef &amp; Game Pit Rub to all sides of the bologna.?#&amp;?#&amp;Light your Pit Barrel Cooker (PBC) according to the instructions. Oil the grate so the meat will not stick. Place the meat on its side on the grate. Add your preferred wood for smoke- I added cherry wood. Cook until you reach an internal temperature of 140 degrees as measured with an internal read thermometer (I recommend the Thermapen for accurate internal temperature readings). This should take approximately 2 &#189; hrs depending on the weather conditions.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the bologna from the grate. Glaze with the BBQ glaze. Don’t overdo the sauce; use just enough to coat the bologna. Put the bologna back on the PBC and cook for 10-15 minutes. Just enough to set the glaze.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove and loosely cover the bologna with aluminum foil while you prep for your bologna sandwich. Take two pieces of Wonder Texas Toast, lie them on the grate and cook with the lid off until you see some grill marks.&#160; Slice the bologna to your desired thickness and then put mayonnaise, tomato, sliced onion and lettuce on your sandwich and enjoy.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat your grill up, preparing it for medium direct cooking- at a temperature of approximately 350 degrees. This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half. Get all your other ingredients ready to take outside- I usually put everything on a big cutting board and carry it outside and then get another plate for switching out.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the grill is heated up, place the cast iron on one half of the grill and add the bacon and let it reduce. Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the bison meat with the minced garlic and add the butter a dash of Worcestershire sauce (bison meat is lean so the butter adds fat= moisture). Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the backbone of the quail in half so you can spread the birds flat on the grill. Next, combine the next ingredients with an immersion blender to form a seasoning paste. Using your index finger, gently separate the skin from the muscle, being careful not to tear the skin. Now, slather the seasoning paste generously under and over the skin of the quail. Let the quail marinate in the fridge for at least an hour before grilling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for 350 degrees, direct heat (ie, over the coals/gas). Oil your grill grates with canola or vegetable oil so your quail will not stick to the grill grates- don’t forget this step, Very Important! Grill the quail for 6-8 minutes PER SIDE or until an internal read thermometer reads 170 degrees. Remove the quail and let rest under foil for 10 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pair with your favorite sides! This recipe is perfect for date night or having friends over- the quail are so pretty on the plate and they grill up in no time!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;To begin cooking extravaganza trim away any excess fat from the goat leg. Expose as much of the meat as possible the set it aside. Goat can be a rather tough meat if prepared incorrectly. The best way to tenderize the meat is a good brine. Take the first 2 bottles of Guinness and pour them into a small stock pot. Open the 3rd bottle and enjoy. Add the 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt to the Guinness and simmer until dissolved. Add 3 cups of water to the mixture and allow it to cool. Place the goat leg in a container large enough that it can lay flat and pour the Guinness brine over the leg.&#160; Leave in the brine for 3-5 hours rotating the leg every 30 mins. While we brine the leg…may as well have that other bottle of Guinness.?#&amp;?#&amp;This would also be a great time to start working on the next step – BACON WEAVNG. Take a large sheet of aluminum foil (Large enough to cover the goat leg) and begin weaving. Think back to elementary school and making mats out of construction paper….it is the same, but with tasty, tasty bacon. If you aren’t a master bacon weaver, don’t worries you can lay out the bacon in overlapping strips.&#160; This would also be a good time to bring your smoker up to 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;After 3-5 hrs, remove the goat leg from the brine and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the entire leg down with the softened butter and minced garlic. Once rubbed down, sprinkle the shredded mint leaves over the leg. Now wrap the bacon around the leg. Make sure you leave no gaps…add more bacon. Now that it is happily wrapped in bacon wrap the leg in aluminum foil. Place the leg in the smoker and cook 12-14 hrs (depending on the size of the leg) at 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;Take a nap…have a drink or two, like Robyn’s Grilled Margaritas.?#&amp;?#&amp;An hour or so before the meat is done start working on your Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze and Blue Cheese Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze: Pour the wine into a medium sauce pan. Add the onion powder, garlic, cayenne and black pepper. Bring the mix to boil for 2-3 min then bring the heat down to a simmer for 10- 15 min.&#160; Remove from heat and set to the side.&#160; Pour yourself a glass or two of wine. It’s not too early is it??#&amp;?#&amp;Blue Cheese Sauce: Add the garlic, onions, and fire-roasted pepper to a large skillet and heat until the onions begin to sweat. Add the blue cheese and heavy cream to the mix and continue stirring until the cheese is blended smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now that the goat has been on for the 12-14 hours remove it from the smoker and allow it to rest 15 – 20 mins in the foil. Unwrap the foil and the bacon…but don’t discard the bacon…its bacon…eat it…It’s awesome. Pull the meat from the leg like you would a pork shoulder.&#160; Place the meat on toasted wheat rolls.&#160; Drizzle the cracked pepper wine glaze over the pulled goat.&#160; Spoon the blue cheese sauce over top of the meat. Add a piece of lettuce or spinach and Viola!&#160; Pour yourself a drink and Bon Appetite!”</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring your eggs to a low boil and then turn the burner off and let sit for another 10 minutes. Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving. Marinate the chicken wings for 30 minutes before putting on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for medium direct heat at 350 degrees. I used my Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker and set it for 375 degrees with the smoker holes wide open. Grill your wings, turning halfway during the process, for approximately 15-18 minutes OR until the internal temperature has reached 170 degrees with an internal read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;The Chicken wings on the Green Mountain Grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once you’ve reached 170 degrees (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen to check internal temp), pull the wings off and drizzle with the remaining marinade. Prepare for out-of-this-world flavor combination! Enjoy.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing the tops and seeds of the jalapenos, wrap the cheese pieces with a piece of prosciutto. (Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve! These will be the hit of the party, guaranteed!?#&amp;?#&amp;Ready to pop in your mouth!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Puree all marinade ingredients (soy sauce, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, fish sauce, oil, sugar and garlic) with a hand mixer or food processor until it forms a paste.?#&amp;Combine marinade and beef in a non-reactive container and marinate in the refrigerator for four hours.?#&amp;?#&amp;Thread the beef strips onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers.?#&amp;For the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients (sour cream, cilantro and lime juice) and refrigerate until ready to serve).?#&amp;Preheat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat, about 350-400 degrees.?#&amp;Grill the skewers for three minutes on each side or until char marks form. These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Bust out all that ricotta and 6 ounces of mozzarella and another 6 ounces of the shredded Italian cheese.

Room to spare? That’s by design. Add in another teaspoon of meat mix and top it again with shredded cheese. Repeat and then repeat some more.?#&amp;Now it’s time to get hot. Bake all these savory wontons over hot coals at 350 degrees and set your timer for 20 minutes until they’re finished cooking.</Data></Cell>

Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving.

(Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve!

These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat. While grill is heating up, Melt your butter over low heat. Add the garlic and herbs and let reduce down.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilling: If your grill grate skew to being far apart, you will need to put your mussels on a grill/veggies pan. If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper. Pour the butter over the mussels.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are also really great with grilled bread- grill bread pieces until char marks form while also grilling the mussels. Dip them in the drawn butter! YESSSSS! How do you like your mussels? What do you serve them with? I would pair these with a nice glass of wine of course!</Data></Cell>

Bake all these savory wontons over hot coals at 350 degrees and set your timer for 20 minutes until they’re finished cooking.</Data></Cell>

Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving. Marinate the chicken wings for 30 minutes before putting on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for medium direct heat at 350 degrees. I used my Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker and set it for 375 degrees with the smoker holes wide open.

(Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve! These will be the hit of the party, guaranteed!?#&amp;?#&amp;Ready to pop in your mouth!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Puree all marinade ingredients (soy sauce, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, fish sauce, oil, sugar and garlic) with a hand mixer or food processor until it forms a paste.?#&amp;Combine marinade and beef in a non-reactive container and marinate in the refrigerator for four hours.?#&amp;?#&amp;Thread the beef strips onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers.?#&amp;For the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients (sour cream, cilantro and lime juice) and refrigerate until ready to serve).?#&amp;Preheat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat, about 350-400 degrees.?#&amp;Grill the skewers for three minutes on each side or until char marks form. These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add the garlic and herbs and let reduce down.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilling: If your grill grate skew to being far apart, you will need to put your mussels on a grill/veggies pan. If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper. Pour the butter over the mussels.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are also really great with grilled bread- grill bread pieces until char marks form while also grilling the mussels. Dip them in the drawn butter! YESSSSS! How do you like your mussels? What do you serve them with? I would pair these with a nice glass of wine of course!</Data></Cell>

Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving. Marinate the chicken wings for 30 minutes before putting on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for medium direct heat at 350 degrees. I used my Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker and set it for 375 degrees with the smoker holes wide open.

(Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve! These will be the hit of the party, guaranteed!?#&amp;?#&amp;Ready to pop in your mouth!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Puree all marinade ingredients (soy sauce, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, fish sauce, oil, sugar and garlic) with a hand mixer or food processor until it forms a paste.?#&amp;Combine marinade and beef in a non-reactive container and marinate in the refrigerator for four hours.?#&amp;?#&amp;Thread the beef strips onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers.?#&amp;For the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients (sour cream, cilantro and lime juice) and refrigerate until ready to serve).?#&amp;Preheat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat, about 350-400 degrees.?#&amp;Grill the skewers for three minutes on each side or until char marks form. These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add the garlic and herbs and let reduce down.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilling: If your grill grate skew to being far apart, you will need to put your mussels on a grill/veggies pan. If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper. Pour the butter over the mussels.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are also really great with grilled bread- grill bread pieces until char marks form while also grilling the mussels. Dip them in the drawn butter!

Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed.

(Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve!

These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper.

Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed.

After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees).

These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping.

The thinner the better as they will be more malleable to go onto the skewers.?#&amp;Next, thread the shrimp onto the rosemary skewers and alternate shrimp with lemon slices that are folded in half. If you don’t have the rosemary skewers, just use regular bamboo skewers (don’t forget to soak them in water beforehand).?#&amp;Prepare your PitBarrel Cooker for cooking on the grill grates.?#&amp;Once your charcoal is ready to go and you are ready to put your skewers on, throw a few rosemary sprigs on the coals for some additional smoke. This will add some nice additional flavor to the shrimp.?#&amp;Get the grill nice and hot and grill the shrimp only a few minutes on each side, looking for them to turn pink and being careful not to overcook.?#&amp;While grilling the shrimp, throw the remaining lemons on the grill until they get charmarks (These will be served with the shrimp and make for great presentation, plus the grill makes them extra juicy for squeezing on the shrimp right before serving)?#&amp;Once they’ve turned pink, take them off and enjoy a flavorful dish that is a true crowd pleaser!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others.

Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving. Marinate the chicken wings for 30 minutes before putting on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for medium direct heat at 350 degrees. I used my Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker and set it for 375 degrees with the smoker holes wide open.

Prepare for out-of-this-world flavor combination! Enjoy.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing the tops and seeds of the jalapenos, wrap the cheese pieces with a piece of prosciutto. (Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve! These will be the hit of the party, guaranteed!?#&amp;?#&amp;Ready to pop in your mouth!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Puree all marinade ingredients (soy sauce, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, fish sauce, oil, sugar and garlic) with a hand mixer or food processor until it forms a paste.?#&amp;Combine marinade and beef in a non-reactive container and marinate in the refrigerator for four hours.?#&amp;?#&amp;Thread the beef strips onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers.?#&amp;For the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients (sour cream, cilantro and lime juice) and refrigerate until ready to serve).?#&amp;Preheat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat, about 350-400 degrees.?#&amp;Grill the skewers for three minutes on each side or until char marks form. These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool.

Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring your eggs to a low boil and then turn the burner off and let sit for another 10 minutes. Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving. Marinate the chicken wings for 30 minutes before putting on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for medium direct heat at 350 degrees. I used my Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker and set it for 375 degrees with the smoker holes wide open. Grill your wings, turning halfway during the process, for approximately 15-18 minutes OR until the internal temperature has reached 170 degrees with an internal read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;The Chicken wings on the Green Mountain Grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once you’ve reached 170 degrees (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen to check internal temp), pull the wings off and drizzle with the remaining marinade. Prepare for out-of-this-world flavor combination! Enjoy.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing the tops and seeds of the jalapenos, wrap the cheese pieces with a piece of prosciutto. (Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve! These will be the hit of the party, guaranteed!?#&amp;?#&amp;Ready to pop in your mouth!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Puree all marinade ingredients (soy sauce, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, fish sauce, oil, sugar and garlic) with a hand mixer or food processor until it forms a paste.?#&amp;Combine marinade and beef in a non-reactive container and marinate in the refrigerator for four hours.?#&amp;?#&amp;Thread the beef strips onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers.?#&amp;For the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients (sour cream, cilantro and lime juice) and refrigerate until ready to serve).?#&amp;Preheat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat, about 350-400 degrees.?#&amp;Grill the skewers for three minutes on each side or until char marks form. These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Room to spare? That’s by design. Add in another teaspoon of meat mix and top it again with shredded cheese. Repeat and then repeat some more.?#&amp;Now it’s time to get hot. Bake all these savory wontons over hot coals at 350 degrees and set your timer for 20 minutes until they’re finished cooking.</Data></Cell>

Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving.

(Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve!

These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted.

Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Add the garlic and herbs and let reduce down.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilling: If your grill grate skew to being far apart, you will need to put your mussels on a grill/veggies pan. If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper. Pour the butter over the mussels.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are also really great with grilled bread- grill bread pieces until char marks form while also grilling the mussels. Dip them in the drawn butter! YESSSSS! How do you like your mussels? What do you serve them with? I would pair these with a nice glass of wine of course!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

Add the salt, pepper and lemongrass essential oil to it and mix.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, go ahead and preheat your grill to 350 degrees, prepping for direct heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add chicken to another bowl and pour in the remaining coconut milk. Add the rub or curry/salt/pepper to the mix and let marinate for a few minutes. Then, grill the chicken for 5-7 minutes or until the chicken has reached an internal temp of 170 degrees. Pull the chicken off the grill and let rest while you finish up inside.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the chicken is grilling, use a vegetable peeler to create zucchini noodles. You will first need to get some of the skin off and if you “square off” the zucchini- ie, create 4 sides to it, it will be easier to get more usable “noodles” from it. Add the coconut cream with the salt/pepper and lemongrass oil and toss until all the noodles are covered in the coconut milk mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Chop the basil and add to the noodles. Chop the chicken and add to the noodles. Toss everything together one more time. Enjoy the fragrance of the coconut milk, curry, basil and lemon grass coming together in this flavorful “pasta”. This pairs beautifully with a nice Sauvignon Blanc.</Data></Cell>

Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!!

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat oven to 450. Stir biscuit ingredients until a soft dough forms. Place on a surface generously sprinkled with more Bisquick so it does not stick and knead 8-10 times. Next, roll the dough out to 1/2″ thick and cut with a biscuit cutter or glass approx. 2 1/2″ diameter ( again, make sure glass has been dipped in the bisquick mix so it will not stick.) &#160;Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake 7-9 minutes until golden. Please note, the size of your biscuits (and what you used to cut them) will determine baking time so the smaller the biscuits, the faster they will cook.?#&amp;?#&amp;To Serve: Slice the biscuits and layer 2-3 pieces of bacon on them. Add molasses for a sweet and salty treat that will satisfy your craving for some Southern Goodness!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

Add the salt, pepper and lemongrass essential oil to it and mix.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, go ahead and preheat your grill to 350 degrees, prepping for direct heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add chicken to another bowl and pour in the remaining coconut milk. Add the rub or curry/salt/pepper to the mix and let marinate for a few minutes. Then, grill the chicken for 5-7 minutes or until the chicken has reached an internal temp of 170 degrees. Pull the chicken off the grill and let rest while you finish up inside.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the chicken is grilling, use a vegetable peeler to create zucchini noodles. You will first need to get some of the skin off and if you “square off” the zucchini- ie, create 4 sides to it, it will be easier to get more usable “noodles” from it. Add the coconut cream with the salt/pepper and lemongrass oil and toss until all the noodles are covered in the coconut milk mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Chop the basil and add to the noodles. Chop the chicken and add to the noodles. Toss everything together one more time. Enjoy the fragrance of the coconut milk, curry, basil and lemon grass coming together in this flavorful “pasta”. This pairs beautifully with a nice Sauvignon Blanc.</Data></Cell>

Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!!

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat oven to 450. Stir biscuit ingredients until a soft dough forms. Place on a surface generously sprinkled with more Bisquick so it does not stick and knead 8-10 times. Next, roll the dough out to 1/2″ thick and cut with a biscuit cutter or glass approx. 2 1/2″ diameter ( again, make sure glass has been dipped in the bisquick mix so it will not stick.) &#160;Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake 7-9 minutes until golden. Please note, the size of your biscuits (and what you used to cut them) will determine baking time so the smaller the biscuits, the faster they will cook.?#&amp;?#&amp;To Serve: Slice the biscuits and layer 2-3 pieces of bacon on them. Add molasses for a sweet and salty treat that will satisfy your craving for some Southern Goodness!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

Add the salt, pepper and lemongrass essential oil to it and mix.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, go ahead and preheat your grill to 350 degrees, prepping for direct heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add chicken to another bowl and pour in the remaining coconut milk. Add the rub or curry/salt/pepper to the mix and let marinate for a few minutes. Then, grill the chicken for 5-7 minutes or until the chicken has reached an internal temp of 170 degrees. Pull the chicken off the grill and let rest while you finish up inside.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the chicken is grilling, use a vegetable peeler to create zucchini noodles. You will first need to get some of the skin off and if you “square off” the zucchini- ie, create 4 sides to it, it will be easier to get more usable “noodles” from it. Add the coconut cream with the salt/pepper and lemongrass oil and toss until all the noodles are covered in the coconut milk mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Chop the basil and add to the noodles. Chop the chicken and add to the noodles. Toss everything together one more time. Enjoy the fragrance of the coconut milk, curry, basil and lemon grass coming together in this flavorful “pasta”. This pairs beautifully with a nice Sauvignon Blanc.</Data></Cell>

Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!!

Place on a surface generously sprinkled with more Bisquick so it does not stick and knead 8-10 times. Next, roll the dough out to 1/2″ thick and cut with a biscuit cutter or glass approx. 2 1/2″ diameter ( again, make sure glass has been dipped in the bisquick mix so it will not stick.) &#160;Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake 7-9 minutes until golden. Please note, the size of your biscuits (and what you used to cut them) will determine baking time so the smaller the biscuits, the faster they will cook.?#&amp;?#&amp;To Serve: Slice the biscuits and layer 2-3 pieces of bacon on them. Add molasses for a sweet and salty treat that will satisfy your craving for some Southern Goodness!</Data></Cell>

I prefer to bake in 12″ cast iron skillet for pies on my smoker, but a pie plate would work as well.?#&amp;On a pregreased skillet or pie pan, roll out the pie dough into the skillet trying to get the dough to roll up on the sides as far as possible. Next, add your apple mixture.?#&amp;Here’s the fun part! Put the dulce de leche into a Ziploc sandwich bag and add the maldon sea salt and stir tother in the bag with a fork.?#&amp;Next, run it under hot water in the sink so the salt will combine and the caramel will spread more easily. Snip the end of the bag to create a pastry bag.?#&amp;Now, pipe the dulce de leche onto the top of the apple pie mixture. Now sprinkle just a little bit more of salt onto the caramel (don’t overdo it!)?#&amp;Take the other pie crust and put it on top of the pie and seal the edges. Cut a few slits to let the steam escape.?#&amp;Set your Green Mountain Grill or pellet smoker to 300 degrees, and let your pie bake for approximately 45 minutes OR until the crust has browned and the apple mixture will become bubbly. Watch the edges of the crust, if it is browning too quickly cover the edges with foil. It is normal for some of the pie juice to come up on the side of the crust, I believe this is due to the shape of the cast iron skillet.?#&amp;When serving a slice, drizzle more dulce de leche onto each piece for extra yumminess! If you want icecream, I love this with vanilla gelato</Data></Cell>

You’ll need about 3-4 minutes per side just so it can defrost and get some grill marks. On the other half of your grill add your pineapple slices onto direct grill. Grill for about 2 minutes per side – you definitely want some char on them as this helps caramelize the pineapple and adds tons more flavor. In a large bowl spread the mascarpone cheese and drizzle on some honey and add the vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. The honey will not only add tons of flavor but make the cheese softer and easier to spread. Once everything is grilled top the pound cake with the grilled pineapple and a dollop of the honey mascarpone spread. Drizzle with a little extra honey right and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

Add the bourbon, spices, brown sugar and butter and stir to combine.?#&amp;Next, let your refrigerated pie crusts slightly thaw and soften out of the refrigerator. I prefer to bake in 12″ cast iron skillet for pies on my smoker, but a pie plate would work as well.?#&amp;On a pregreased skillet or pie pan, roll out the pie dough into the skillet trying to get the dough to roll up on the sides as far as possible. Next, add your apple mixture.?#&amp;Here’s the fun part! Put the dulce de leche into a Ziploc sandwich bag and add the maldon sea salt and stir tother in the bag with a fork.?#&amp;Next, run it under hot water in the sink so the salt will combine and the caramel will spread more easily. Snip the end of the bag to create a pastry bag.?#&amp;Now, pipe the dulce de leche onto the top of the apple pie mixture. Now sprinkle just a little bit more of salt onto the caramel (don’t overdo it!)?#&amp;Take the other pie crust and put it on top of the pie and seal the edges. Cut a few slits to let the steam escape.?#&amp;Set your Green Mountain Grill or pellet smoker to 300 degrees, and let your pie bake for approximately 45 minutes OR until the crust has browned and the apple mixture will become bubbly. Watch the edges of the crust, if it is browning too quickly cover the edges with foil. It is normal for some of the pie juice to come up on the side of the crust, I believe this is due to the shape of the cast iron skillet.?#&amp;When serving a slice, drizzle more dulce de leche onto each piece for extra yumminess! If you want icecream, I love this with vanilla gelato</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;While your pound cake is still frozen cut it in thick slices at least 2 inches thick. Place the cake on the grill in indirect. You’ll need about 3-4 minutes per side just so it can defrost and get some grill marks. On the other half of your grill add your pineapple slices onto direct grill. Grill for about 2 minutes per side – you definitely want some char on them as this helps caramelize the pineapple and adds tons more flavor. In a large bowl spread the mascarpone cheese and drizzle on some honey and add the vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. The honey will not only add tons of flavor but make the cheese softer and easier to spread. Once everything is grilled top the pound cake with the grilled pineapple and a dollop of the honey mascarpone spread. Drizzle with a little extra honey right and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for indirect grilling. In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

Add the bourbon, spices, brown sugar and butter and stir to combine.?#&amp;Next, let your refrigerated pie crusts slightly thaw and soften out of the refrigerator. I prefer to bake in 12″ cast iron skillet for pies on my smoker, but a pie plate would work as well.?#&amp;On a pregreased skillet or pie pan, roll out the pie dough into the skillet trying to get the dough to roll up on the sides as far as possible. Next, add your apple mixture.?#&amp;Here’s the fun part! Put the dulce de leche into a Ziploc sandwich bag and add the maldon sea salt and stir tother in the bag with a fork.?#&amp;Next, run it under hot water in the sink so the salt will combine and the caramel will spread more easily. Snip the end of the bag to create a pastry bag.?#&amp;Now, pipe the dulce de leche onto the top of the apple pie mixture. Now sprinkle just a little bit more of salt onto the caramel (don’t overdo it!)?#&amp;Take the other pie crust and put it on top of the pie and seal the edges. Cut a few slits to let the steam escape.?#&amp;Set your Green Mountain Grill or pellet smoker to 300 degrees, and let your pie bake for approximately 45 minutes OR until the crust has browned and the apple mixture will become bubbly. Watch the edges of the crust, if it is browning too quickly cover the edges with foil. It is normal for some of the pie juice to come up on the side of the crust, I believe this is due to the shape of the cast iron skillet.?#&amp;When serving a slice, drizzle more dulce de leche onto each piece for extra yumminess! If you want icecream, I love this with vanilla gelato</Data></Cell>

You’ll need about 3-4 minutes per side just so it can defrost and get some grill marks. On the other half of your grill add your pineapple slices onto direct grill. Grill for about 2 minutes per side – you definitely want some char on them as this helps caramelize the pineapple and adds tons more flavor. In a large bowl spread the mascarpone cheese and drizzle on some honey and add the vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. The honey will not only add tons of flavor but make the cheese softer and easier to spread. Once everything is grilled top the pound cake with the grilled pineapple and a dollop of the honey mascarpone spread. Drizzle with a little extra honey right and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for indirect grilling. In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

In the meantime, combine the egg and water with the jiffy cake mix.?#&amp;?#&amp;Coat your 12” cast iron pan with butter or coconut oil so that none of your ingredients stick. Next, add your batter on top. Take a fork and spoon and lightly mix the fruit with the batter so that some of the fruit is visible (don’t mix too much- this is a rustic cobbler).?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook on your PitBarrel that has a hot fire going for about 30 minutes or until the fruit has begun to bubble and the batter has browned on the top. Depending on how hot your PBC is and how much charcoal is left, this may take up to 45 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream. Delish and super easy!! If you love cobbler, I have a ton of cobbler recipes including a mango ginger cobbler and my Red, White and Blue cobbler that are always a big hit!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;While your pound cake is still frozen cut it in thick slices at least 2 inches thick. Place the cake on the grill in indirect. You’ll need about 3-4 minutes per side just so it can defrost and get some grill marks. On the other half of your grill add your pineapple slices onto direct grill. Grill for about 2 minutes per side – you definitely want some char on them as this helps caramelize the pineapple and adds tons more flavor. In a large bowl spread the mascarpone cheese and drizzle on some honey and add the vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. The honey will not only add tons of flavor but make the cheese softer and easier to spread. Once everything is grilled top the pound cake with the grilled pineapple and a dollop of the honey mascarpone spread. Drizzle with a little extra honey right and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for indirect grilling. In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

Snip the end of the bag to create a pastry bag.?#&amp;Now, pipe the dulce de leche onto the top of the apple pie mixture.

Cut a few slits to let the steam escape.?#&amp;Set your Green Mountain Grill or pellet smoker to 300 degrees, and let your pie bake for approximately 45 minutes OR until the crust has browned and the apple mixture will become bubbly. Watch the edges of the crust, if it is browning too quickly cover the edges with foil. It is normal for some of the pie juice to come up on the side of the crust, I believe this is due to the shape of the cast iron skillet.?#&amp;When serving a slice, drizzle more dulce de leche onto each piece for extra yumminess! If you want icecream, I love this with vanilla gelato</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;While your pound cake is still frozen cut it in thick slices at least 2 inches thick. Place the cake on the grill in indirect. You’ll need about 3-4 minutes per side just so it can defrost and get some grill marks. On the other half of your grill add your pineapple slices onto direct grill. Grill for about 2 minutes per side – you definitely want some char on them as this helps caramelize the pineapple and adds tons more flavor. In a large bowl spread the mascarpone cheese and drizzle on some honey and add the vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg. The honey will not only add tons of flavor but make the cheese softer and easier to spread. Once everything is grilled top the pound cake with the grilled pineapple and a dollop of the honey mascarpone spread. Drizzle with a little extra honey right and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for indirect grilling. In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides.

After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!!

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

Place your ribs on a foil pan and cook on indirect heat for about 45 – 60&#160;minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;In a sauce pan heat up the leftover marinade. You want to make sure it comes to a full boil {to avoid any cross contamination} – boil it for about 5 minutes then cook it on low for about another 15 – 20 minutes. You will use this sauce to baste the ribs halfway into the cooking time. I don’t recommend saving this sauce for later use, whatever you don’t use basting&#160;should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the ribs from the pan and place them directly on the grill. Brush the ribs with the prepared sauce&#160;&#160;and cook for about 10 minutes on medium low heat, until the BBQ sauce starts to caramelize.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

Place your ribs on a foil pan and cook on indirect heat for about 45 – 60&#160;minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;In a sauce pan heat up the leftover marinade. You want to make sure it comes to a full boil {to avoid any cross contamination} – boil it for about 5 minutes then cook it on low for about another 15 – 20 minutes. You will use this sauce to baste the ribs halfway into the cooking time. I don’t recommend saving this sauce for later use, whatever you don’t use basting&#160;should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the ribs from the pan and place them directly on the grill. Brush the ribs with the prepared sauce&#160;&#160;and cook for about 10 minutes on medium low heat, until the BBQ sauce starts to caramelize.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees and prepare for direct heat. Meanwhile, toss the shrimp in olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning. Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!! My favorite with Shrimp and Grits is Texas Pete.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for indirect grilling. In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for indirect grilling. In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

Remove and let cool.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, grill the pork tenderloin filets- about 5 minutes max, or until the internal temp reads 145 degrees with an internal read thermometer (I recommend the thermapen).?#&amp;On the indirect side, toast the rolls very quickly being careful to not let them burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Slice the peppers and then combine the mayo with the sriracha and spread on the buns. Now, assemble your sliders with the tenderloin, pineapple and peppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;The sweetness of the pineapple and peppers in this recipe really compliment the spice of the Black Pepper marinated pork tenderloin, don’t be surprised that you’ll go back for seconds or thirds!?#&amp;?#&amp;What are your favorite recipes for getting dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes?

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for indirect grilling. In a large saucepan melt down your butter and add all the ingredients {minus the granny smith apples, but add the other apples}. Bring to a boil and then slowly simmer until the sauce thickens into a syrupy consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush your grilling apples with some of the butter mixture and&#160;grill them for a few minutes per side {just enough to get grill marks}. It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling&#160;apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}. &#160;Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.</Data></Cell>

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper. Pour the butter over the mussels.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are also really great with grilled bread- grill bread pieces until char marks form while also grilling the mussels. Dip them in the drawn butter!

Save any remaining lemon and lime slices for serving with the fish once it’s cooked.?#&amp;?#&amp;3) Place the snapper on a frog mat and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees- this will take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour depending on the size of the fish.?#&amp;?#&amp;4) Once the internal temp has been met, remove and serve immediately with remaining lemon and lime slices. The outer filets will remove pretty cleanly for serving but be extra vigilant about looking for bones before serving guests.</Data></Cell>

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper.

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper. Pour the butter over the mussels.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are also really great with grilled bread- grill bread pieces until char marks form while also grilling the mussels. Dip them in the drawn butter!

If they are within a small enough apart, you can grill the mussels directly on the grates. Grill the mussels until the pop open. This will be around 5 minutes or so… The ones that open move to a less hot part of the grill while waiting on the others. Any mussels that don’t open should be thrown away.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the mussels in a big bowl and add sea salt and pepper. Pour the butter over the mussels.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are also really great with grilled bread- grill bread pieces until char marks form while also grilling the mussels. Dip them in the drawn butter! YESSSSS! How do you like your mussels? What do you serve them with? I would pair these with a nice glass of wine of course!</Data></Cell>

I give them a good 10-15&#160;minutes to grill and then I cover them with the vents open. Leave them for about another 25 minutes and then turn and cover. Once you have an internal temperature of at least 165 bring them to the direct heat so they can get a nice char not them. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

I give them a good 10-15&#160;minutes to grill and then I cover them with the vents open. Leave them for about another 25 minutes and then turn and cover. Once you have an internal temperature of at least 165 bring them to the direct heat so they can get a nice char not them. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Store in the fridge to marinate for at least an hour {overnight is best}. Preheat your grill {we use a charcoal} to 350 degrees. Line the thighs up on indirect heat skin facing up. I give them a good 10-15&#160;minutes to grill and then I cover them with the vents open. Leave them for about another 25 minutes and then turn and cover. Once you have an internal temperature of at least 165 bring them to the direct heat so they can get a nice char not them. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes and enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees and prepare for direct heat. Meanwhile, toss the shrimp in olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning. Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!! My favorite with Shrimp and Grits is Texas Pete.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin? Please share!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;When smoking other things, go ahead and take the opportunity to add peaches and poblanos to put into the cornbread recipe!?#&amp;?#&amp;Add halved peaches and poblano pepper to the smoker and let the peaches smoke for 30-35 minutes. I used peach wood to compliment the flavor of the peach. Let the pepper smoke for an hour. Remove and keep in the refrigerator until ready to bake the cornbread.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Coat cast iron skillet with a tablespoon of butter on the bottom and sides of the skillet. Combine dry ingredients in one bowl: cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar. In another bowl, combine the wet ingredients: beaten eggs, milk, and butter. Finely chop one and a half of the peaches, reserving one half to top the cornbread. Slice the remaining half-peach thinly lengthwise. Finely chop the poblano, also reserving a few pieces for the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Add the chopped peaches and poblanos and fold in. Pour the batter into the cast iron skillet. In the middle of the skillet, arrange the remaining peach slices in a circle in the middle. Sprinkle remaining chopped poblanos on top –&#160; this will make for an eye-catching presentation once baked.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake the cornbread for 20-25 minutes until browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Serve with butter and honey. I dare you to eat just one piece!?#&amp;?#&amp;Tip Bubble:&#160;Blue cornmeal can be found from Anson Mills, War Eagle Farms, and Bob’s Red Mill. If the cornmeal is very coarse, pulse in the food processor before baking with it for a finer texture. Gluten-free all-purpose flour can easily be used in any baking recipe – I recommend “Cup for Cup” all-purpose gluten-free flour. It can easily be found on Amazon.com.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pairing Suggestions/Maximizing Leftovers: For a sweeter cornbread without adding extra calories, add 2 tablespoons stevia in the raw to the batter before baking. This cornbread is great paired with any dish that comes out of the smoker!</Data></Cell>

If your sprouts are still on the stalk, place it directly on the cooking grate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Your sprouts will take about 20 minutes to cook, though a bit faster if you have par-cooked them. Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

Add the bourbon, spices, brown sugar and butter and stir to combine.?#&amp;Next, let your refrigerated pie crusts slightly thaw and soften out of the refrigerator. I prefer to bake in 12″ cast iron skillet for pies on my smoker, but a pie plate would work as well.?#&amp;On a pregreased skillet or pie pan, roll out the pie dough into the skillet trying to get the dough to roll up on the sides as far as possible. Next, add your apple mixture.?#&amp;Here’s the fun part! Put the dulce de leche into a Ziploc sandwich bag and add the maldon sea salt and stir tother in the bag with a fork.?#&amp;Next, run it under hot water in the sink so the salt will combine and the caramel will spread more easily. Snip the end of the bag to create a pastry bag.?#&amp;Now, pipe the dulce de leche onto the top of the apple pie mixture. Now sprinkle just a little bit more of salt onto the caramel (don’t overdo it!)?#&amp;Take the other pie crust and put it on top of the pie and seal the edges. Cut a few slits to let the steam escape.?#&amp;Set your Green Mountain Grill or pellet smoker to 300 degrees, and let your pie bake for approximately 45 minutes OR until the crust has browned and the apple mixture will become bubbly. Watch the edges of the crust, if it is browning too quickly cover the edges with foil. It is normal for some of the pie juice to come up on the side of the crust, I believe this is due to the shape of the cast iron skillet.?#&amp;When serving a slice, drizzle more dulce de leche onto each piece for extra yumminess! If you want icecream, I love this with vanilla gelato</Data></Cell>

This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half. Get all your other ingredients ready to take outside- I usually put everything on a big cutting board and carry it outside and then get another plate for switching out.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the grill is heated up, place the cast iron on one half of the grill and add the bacon and let it reduce. Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;When smoking other things, go ahead and take the opportunity to add peaches and poblanos to put into the cornbread recipe!?#&amp;?#&amp;Add halved peaches and poblano pepper to the smoker and let the peaches smoke for 30-35 minutes. I used peach wood to compliment the flavor of the peach. Let the pepper smoke for an hour. Remove and keep in the refrigerator until ready to bake the cornbread.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Coat cast iron skillet with a tablespoon of butter on the bottom and sides of the skillet. Combine dry ingredients in one bowl: cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar. In another bowl, combine the wet ingredients: beaten eggs, milk, and butter. Finely chop one and a half of the peaches, reserving one half to top the cornbread. Slice the remaining half-peach thinly lengthwise. Finely chop the poblano, also reserving a few pieces for the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Add the chopped peaches and poblanos and fold in. Pour the batter into the cast iron skillet. In the middle of the skillet, arrange the remaining peach slices in a circle in the middle. Sprinkle remaining chopped poblanos on top –&#160; this will make for an eye-catching presentation once baked.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake the cornbread for 20-25 minutes until browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Serve with butter and honey. I dare you to eat just one piece!?#&amp;?#&amp;Tip Bubble:&#160;Blue cornmeal can be found from Anson Mills, War Eagle Farms, and Bob’s Red Mill. If the cornmeal is very coarse, pulse in the food processor before baking with it for a finer texture. Gluten-free all-purpose flour can easily be used in any baking recipe – I recommend “Cup for Cup” all-purpose gluten-free flour. It can easily be found on Amazon.com.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pairing Suggestions/Maximizing Leftovers: For a sweeter cornbread without adding extra calories, add 2 tablespoons stevia in the raw to the batter before baking. This cornbread is great paired with any dish that comes out of the smoker!</Data></Cell>

Add the bourbon, spices, brown sugar and butter and stir to combine.?#&amp;Next, let your refrigerated pie crusts slightly thaw and soften out of the refrigerator. I prefer to bake in 12″ cast iron skillet for pies on my smoker, but a pie plate would work as well.?#&amp;On a pregreased skillet or pie pan, roll out the pie dough into the skillet trying to get the dough to roll up on the sides as far as possible. Next, add your apple mixture.?#&amp;Here’s the fun part! Put the dulce de leche into a Ziploc sandwich bag and add the maldon sea salt and stir tother in the bag with a fork.?#&amp;Next, run it under hot water in the sink so the salt will combine and the caramel will spread more easily. Snip the end of the bag to create a pastry bag.?#&amp;Now, pipe the dulce de leche onto the top of the apple pie mixture. Now sprinkle just a little bit more of salt onto the caramel (don’t overdo it!)?#&amp;Take the other pie crust and put it on top of the pie and seal the edges. Cut a few slits to let the steam escape.?#&amp;Set your Green Mountain Grill or pellet smoker to 300 degrees, and let your pie bake for approximately 45 minutes OR until the crust has browned and the apple mixture will become bubbly. Watch the edges of the crust, if it is browning too quickly cover the edges with foil. It is normal for some of the pie juice to come up on the side of the crust, I believe this is due to the shape of the cast iron skillet.?#&amp;When serving a slice, drizzle more dulce de leche onto each piece for extra yumminess! If you want icecream, I love this with vanilla gelato</Data></Cell>

This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half. Get all your other ingredients ready to take outside- I usually put everything on a big cutting board and carry it outside and then get another plate for switching out.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the grill is heated up, place the cast iron on one half of the grill and add the bacon and let it reduce. Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;When smoking other things, go ahead and take the opportunity to add peaches and poblanos to put into the cornbread recipe!?#&amp;?#&amp;Add halved peaches and poblano pepper to the smoker and let the peaches smoke for 30-35 minutes. I used peach wood to compliment the flavor of the peach. Let the pepper smoke for an hour. Remove and keep in the refrigerator until ready to bake the cornbread.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Coat cast iron skillet with a tablespoon of butter on the bottom and sides of the skillet. Combine dry ingredients in one bowl: cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sugar. In another bowl, combine the wet ingredients: beaten eggs, milk, and butter. Finely chop one and a half of the peaches, reserving one half to top the cornbread. Slice the remaining half-peach thinly lengthwise. Finely chop the poblano, also reserving a few pieces for the top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Add the chopped peaches and poblanos and fold in. Pour the batter into the cast iron skillet. In the middle of the skillet, arrange the remaining peach slices in a circle in the middle. Sprinkle remaining chopped poblanos on top –&#160; this will make for an eye-catching presentation once baked.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake the cornbread for 20-25 minutes until browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Serve with butter and honey. I dare you to eat just one piece!?#&amp;?#&amp;Tip Bubble:&#160;Blue cornmeal can be found from Anson Mills, War Eagle Farms, and Bob’s Red Mill. If the cornmeal is very coarse, pulse in the food processor before baking with it for a finer texture. Gluten-free all-purpose flour can easily be used in any baking recipe – I recommend “Cup for Cup” all-purpose gluten-free flour. It can easily be found on Amazon.com.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pairing Suggestions/Maximizing Leftovers: For a sweeter cornbread without adding extra calories, add 2 tablespoons stevia in the raw to the batter before baking. This cornbread is great paired with any dish that comes out of the smoker!</Data></Cell>

Add the bourbon, spices, brown sugar and butter and stir to combine.?#&amp;Next, let your refrigerated pie crusts slightly thaw and soften out of the refrigerator. I prefer to bake in 12″ cast iron skillet for pies on my smoker, but a pie plate would work as well.?#&amp;On a pregreased skillet or pie pan, roll out the pie dough into the skillet trying to get the dough to roll up on the sides as far as possible. Next, add your apple mixture.?#&amp;Here’s the fun part! Put the dulce de leche into a Ziploc sandwich bag and add the maldon sea salt and stir tother in the bag with a fork.?#&amp;Next, run it under hot water in the sink so the salt will combine and the caramel will spread more easily. Snip the end of the bag to create a pastry bag.?#&amp;Now, pipe the dulce de leche onto the top of the apple pie mixture. Now sprinkle just a little bit more of salt onto the caramel (don’t overdo it!)?#&amp;Take the other pie crust and put it on top of the pie and seal the edges. Cut a few slits to let the steam escape.?#&amp;Set your Green Mountain Grill or pellet smoker to 300 degrees, and let your pie bake for approximately 45 minutes OR until the crust has browned and the apple mixture will become bubbly. Watch the edges of the crust, if it is browning too quickly cover the edges with foil. It is normal for some of the pie juice to come up on the side of the crust, I believe this is due to the shape of the cast iron skillet.?#&amp;When serving a slice, drizzle more dulce de leche onto each piece for extra yumminess! If you want icecream, I love this with vanilla gelato</Data></Cell>

This means you will be cooking directly over the fire!?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill heats up go ahead and prepare your ingredients for the grill; chop the bacon, carrots and celery and garlic. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2 thick pieces, and slice onion into rings for the grill, cut the tomatoes in half. Get all your other ingredients ready to take outside- I usually put everything on a big cutting board and carry it outside and then get another plate for switching out.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the grill is heated up, place the cast iron on one half of the grill and add the bacon and let it reduce. Meanwhile, with your existing grill surface area, go ahead and grill the pork tenderloin. This will only take a few minutes per side, remove once char marks have begun to form (remember these will also go into the stew and continue to cook). Next, grill the tomatoes and onions until char marks have formed, then remove from the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the dutch oven, once the bacon fat has rendered, add the carrots and celery and let them cook in the bacon fat. Meanwhile, chop the onions and tomatoes and add to the dutch oven, stirring frequently to ensure no bacon is burning on the bottom. Now add the garlic. Next, add the first Guinness beer and deglaze the bottom of the pan. Add the sugar and stir. Now, chop the pork into small bite sized pieces and add to the dutch oven. Last but not least, add the beans and thyme and let the cassoulet simmer for 10 minutes or until the liquid has reduced. If you like a more soup like stew, add another 1/2 to full beer, depending on how much time you have to let simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Cassoulet simmers on the grill, slice the French bread into 1” thick pieces and slather with butter on both sides. Grill very quickly – no more than a minute- to get grill marks, ensuring you don’t let it burn.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the Cassoulet with the grilled bread and be prepared for big smiles on the faces of your family- like I said, this recipe is pure comfort food and expect to add this to your list of recipes you make again and again. Also great for freezing and giving to those in need of an easy meal- like friends and family going through an illness or just home with a new baby.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you give this recipe a try, please let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Also, when reheating you’ll notice that the beans soak up a lot of the liquid. You can add more beer if you want more stew like consistency before reheating.</Data></Cell>

Let the nuts dry out before baking with them.?#&amp;Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.?#&amp;Meanwhile, in a medium sized saucepan melt butter on medium low and add the brown sugar and corn syrup and stir to combine.?#&amp;Next, add the orange peel, bourbon, vanilla and cinnamon and remove from the heat.?#&amp;Beat the eggs in a bowl and add to the sugar mixture once it has significantly cooled.?#&amp;Roll the pie crust out into a 12” cast iron skillet slightly crimping the edges. Fill with the pecans. Pour the sugar mixture over the pecans. Bake for 50 minutes or until the mixture is set and the crust has browned.?#&amp;Remove from the oven and let cool. Excellent served with vanilla ice cream or homemade whipped cream.?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Roll the foil packet together tightly together on all sides. Place the foil packet(s) directly on the coals or on the grill on direct heat and let grill for 15-20 minutes.

Next, add the oil and green onion and blend again until uniformly mixed. Add black pepper to your liking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, devein and butterfly these large prawns so they will grill evenly being careful to remove the waste vein. (When purchasing shrimp, it’s a bonus if you can find them deveined already and there is no&#160;need to butterfly) You will grill these prawns much like lobster in that they will need to be butterflied on both sides to grill evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the prawns or shrimp for 30 minutes at room temp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium high direct heat (about 350-375 degrees). Make sure to oil your grill grates so the prawns will not stick! Grill the prawns about 6-8 minutes per side or until they begin to form nice charm marks. Use your thermapen to ensure your prawns have reached an internal temp of 145 degrees and pull them off.?#&amp;?#&amp;I paired these with Asian Slaw and Coconut Rice, both of which I made beforehand so I could spend more time with my dinner guests when they came over. Plus, slaw is always better when it has time to marinate.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Get out one medium bowl for mixing the liquids and one large serving bowl for the slaw. Combine the rice vinegar, sesame oil, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger and garlic with a whisk until uniform in consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the larger bowl, combine the slaw mix, red bell pepper, green onions and cilantro. Toss the liquid ingredients into the cabbage mix and combine. Let marinate in the fridge at least an hour before serving.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Before embarking on making this rice dish, you will need to refrigerate the 2 cans of coconut milk in the fridge an hour before preparing. This is to make it easy to scoop the thick coconut “cream” off the top to use for this recipe. The remaining coconut milk/water can be used in other recipes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the rice, the 1.5 cups coconut cream, sugar, salt and water in a saucepan. Stir briefly to combine the sugar, rice and coconut cream. Bring to a boil, then cover and let simmer on low heat for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the burner and fluff the rice with a fork, let it sit covered for another 20 minutes to continue to steam.?#&amp;?#&amp;This rice will knock your socks off!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees and prepare for direct heat. Meanwhile, toss the shrimp in olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning. Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!! My favorite with Shrimp and Grits is Texas Pete.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees. Create a direct and indirect heating zone (the tomatoes will be grilled direct, crostini indirect). Slice your tomatoes in half and drizzle them in a little olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the tomatoes &#160;until the form a nice char on both sides, this will take approximately 15 minutes (give or take), depending on your grill. Once your tomatoes are nice and charred, put them in a deep sauce pot and put them on the stove. Using an immersion blender, blend the tomatoes together. Next, add the chicken broth and remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth. Place the pot on low-medium heat so the soup will be warm for serving.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, take a baquette and make 1/2 inch or smaller slices. Coat them in olive oil on both sides. Grill the crostini on indirect heat until toasted, about 2 minutes each side. Remove from grill and layer crostini, cheese, meat, peppers, and arugula and repeat, sandwiching a crostini on each each. Stick a skewer in through the middle to keep the pieces together. Serve with the soup for a sassy presentation that is perfect for dipping in the soup!?#&amp;?#&amp;Alas, this is one of those recipes that I just made that turned out wonderfully. I love those redeeming recipes that come out so great, to make up for the ones that don’t. I hope you enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Next, add the oil and green onion and blend again until uniformly mixed. Add black pepper to your liking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, devein and butterfly these large prawns so they will grill evenly being careful to remove the waste vein. (When purchasing shrimp, it’s a bonus if you can find them deveined already and there is no&#160;need to butterfly) You will grill these prawns much like lobster in that they will need to be butterflied on both sides to grill evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the prawns or shrimp for 30 minutes at room temp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium high direct heat (about 350-375 degrees). Make sure to oil your grill grates so the prawns will not stick! Grill the prawns about 6-8 minutes per side or until they begin to form nice charm marks. Use your thermapen to ensure your prawns have reached an internal temp of 145 degrees and pull them off.?#&amp;?#&amp;I paired these with Asian Slaw and Coconut Rice, both of which I made beforehand so I could spend more time with my dinner guests when they came over. Plus, slaw is always better when it has time to marinate.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Get out one medium bowl for mixing the liquids and one large serving bowl for the slaw. Combine the rice vinegar, sesame oil, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger and garlic with a whisk until uniform in consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the larger bowl, combine the slaw mix, red bell pepper, green onions and cilantro. Toss the liquid ingredients into the cabbage mix and combine. Let marinate in the fridge at least an hour before serving.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Before embarking on making this rice dish, you will need to refrigerate the 2 cans of coconut milk in the fridge an hour before preparing. This is to make it easy to scoop the thick coconut “cream” off the top to use for this recipe. The remaining coconut milk/water can be used in other recipes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the rice, the 1.5 cups coconut cream, sugar, salt and water in a saucepan. Stir briefly to combine the sugar, rice and coconut cream. Bring to a boil, then cover and let simmer on low heat for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the burner and fluff the rice with a fork, let it sit covered for another 20 minutes to continue to steam.?#&amp;?#&amp;This rice will knock your socks off!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees and prepare for direct heat. Meanwhile, toss the shrimp in olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning. Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!! My favorite with Shrimp and Grits is Texas Pete.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees. Create a direct and indirect heating zone (the tomatoes will be grilled direct, crostini indirect). Slice your tomatoes in half and drizzle them in a little olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the tomatoes &#160;until the form a nice char on both sides, this will take approximately 15 minutes (give or take), depending on your grill. Once your tomatoes are nice and charred, put them in a deep sauce pot and put them on the stove. Using an immersion blender, blend the tomatoes together. Next, add the chicken broth and remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth. Place the pot on low-medium heat so the soup will be warm for serving.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, take a baquette and make 1/2 inch or smaller slices. Coat them in olive oil on both sides. Grill the crostini on indirect heat until toasted, about 2 minutes each side. Remove from grill and layer crostini, cheese, meat, peppers, and arugula and repeat, sandwiching a crostini on each each. Stick a skewer in through the middle to keep the pieces together. Serve with the soup for a sassy presentation that is perfect for dipping in the soup!?#&amp;?#&amp;Alas, this is one of those recipes that I just made that turned out wonderfully. I love those redeeming recipes that come out so great, to make up for the ones that don’t. I hope you enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the first 6 ingredients (shallots, ginger, soy, lime juice and sugar) in a blender and liquefy until all ingredients are mixed up. Next, add the oil and green onion and blend again until uniformly mixed. Add black pepper to your liking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, devein and butterfly these large prawns so they will grill evenly being careful to remove the waste vein. (When purchasing shrimp, it’s a bonus if you can find them deveined already and there is no&#160;need to butterfly) You will grill these prawns much like lobster in that they will need to be butterflied on both sides to grill evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;Marinate the prawns or shrimp for 30 minutes at room temp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium high direct heat (about 350-375 degrees). Make sure to oil your grill grates so the prawns will not stick! Grill the prawns about 6-8 minutes per side or until they begin to form nice charm marks. Use your thermapen to ensure your prawns have reached an internal temp of 145 degrees and pull them off.?#&amp;?#&amp;I paired these with Asian Slaw and Coconut Rice, both of which I made beforehand so I could spend more time with my dinner guests when they came over. Plus, slaw is always better when it has time to marinate.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Get out one medium bowl for mixing the liquids and one large serving bowl for the slaw. Combine the rice vinegar, sesame oil, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger and garlic with a whisk until uniform in consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the larger bowl, combine the slaw mix, red bell pepper, green onions and cilantro. Toss the liquid ingredients into the cabbage mix and combine. Let marinate in the fridge at least an hour before serving.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Before embarking on making this rice dish, you will need to refrigerate the 2 cans of coconut milk in the fridge an hour before preparing. This is to make it easy to scoop the thick coconut “cream” off the top to use for this recipe. The remaining coconut milk/water can be used in other recipes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the rice, the 1.5 cups coconut cream, sugar, salt and water in a saucepan. Stir briefly to combine the sugar, rice and coconut cream. Bring to a boil, then cover and let simmer on low heat for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the burner and fluff the rice with a fork, let it sit covered for another 20 minutes to continue to steam.?#&amp;?#&amp;This rice will knock your socks off!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees and prepare for direct heat. Meanwhile, toss the shrimp in olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning. Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!! My favorite with Shrimp and Grits is Texas Pete.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees. Create a direct and indirect heating zone (the tomatoes will be grilled direct, crostini indirect). Slice your tomatoes in half and drizzle them in a little olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the tomatoes &#160;until the form a nice char on both sides, this will take approximately 15 minutes (give or take), depending on your grill. Once your tomatoes are nice and charred, put them in a deep sauce pot and put them on the stove. Using an immersion blender, blend the tomatoes together. Next, add the chicken broth and remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth. Place the pot on low-medium heat so the soup will be warm for serving.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, take a baquette and make 1/2 inch or smaller slices. Coat them in olive oil on both sides. Grill the crostini on indirect heat until toasted, about 2 minutes each side. Remove from grill and layer crostini, cheese, meat, peppers, and arugula and repeat, sandwiching a crostini on each each. Stick a skewer in through the middle to keep the pieces together. Serve with the soup for a sassy presentation that is perfect for dipping in the soup!?#&amp;?#&amp;Alas, this is one of those recipes that I just made that turned out wonderfully. I love those redeeming recipes that come out so great, to make up for the ones that don’t. I hope you enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees and prepare for direct heat. Meanwhile, toss the shrimp in olive oil and Old Bay Seasoning. Thread the shrimp on the skewers. Next, grill the shrimp for 2 minutes per side or until pink and remove from the grill- DO NOT Overcook. Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!! My favorite with Shrimp and Grits is Texas Pete.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees. Create a direct and indirect heating zone (the tomatoes will be grilled direct, crostini indirect). Slice your tomatoes in half and drizzle them in a little olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the tomatoes &#160;until the form a nice char on both sides, this will take approximately 15 minutes (give or take), depending on your grill. Once your tomatoes are nice and charred, put them in a deep sauce pot and put them on the stove. Using an immersion blender, blend the tomatoes together. Next, add the chicken broth and remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth. Place the pot on low-medium heat so the soup will be warm for serving.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, take a baquette and make 1/2 inch or smaller slices. Coat them in olive oil on both sides. Grill the crostini on indirect heat until toasted, about 2 minutes each side. Remove from grill and layer crostini, cheese, meat, peppers, and arugula and repeat, sandwiching a crostini on each each. Stick a skewer in through the middle to keep the pieces together. Serve with the soup for a sassy presentation that is perfect for dipping in the soup!?#&amp;?#&amp;Alas, this is one of those recipes that I just made that turned out wonderfully. I love those redeeming recipes that come out so great, to make up for the ones that don’t. I hope you enjoy!</Data></Cell>

Pour 2 cups of Coca Cola and 1/8 cup of bourbon into the pan. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, return to the PBC, and cook two more hours. Remove the ribs from the pan. Glaze the ribs with the sweet BBQ glaze. (See recipe below) Don’t overdo the sauce – use just enough to coat the ribs. Put the ribs back on the PBC and cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Just enough to set the glaze.?#&amp;Remove the ribs from the PBC and let the ribs sit. Loosely covered with aluminum foil for 10 to 15 minutes. Then chow down.</Data></Cell>

Cut it in half so each strip is no longer than 5 inches in length and no longer than 4 inches in width.?#&amp;In large gallon zip lock bags, add the meat and the marinade and let marinate in the fridge overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing from the fridge?#&amp;?#&amp;Double up the skewers so that each piece is hanging from two skewers. The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&amp;Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&amp;On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&amp;Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&amp;Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&amp;**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&amp;After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&amp;Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&amp;Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks.

Apply the rub and smoke the meat for 2 hours.?#&amp;After 2 hours, remove from the smoker and do the “Texas Crutch,” i.e., “wrap in foil”. Mix the apple juice and pineapple preserve and add to the foil packet. Let smoke another two hours.?#&amp;Meanwhile, as the meat is smoking make your rum barbecue sauce. Combine the BBQ sauce, pineapple preserves, rum, chopped pineapple, pineapple juice and allspice. Let reduce down for 20 minutes on medium simmer.?#&amp;During the last hour, remove the ribs from foil and glaze with the pineapple rum BBQ sauce.?#&amp;Layer slices of pineapple on top of the ribs and drizzle more sauce over the pineapple.?#&amp;Let smoke for an additional hour to let the sauce set.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring your eggs to a low boil and then turn the burner off and let sit for another 10 minutes. Rinse in cold water, then crack and peel under the faucet as the water is running over them (this helps get the shell off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, slice the eggs in half and remove the yolk. Mix the yolk, mayo, relish, mustard, salt and pepper together with a fork until uniform in consistency. Put the mixture in a big ziplock bag and then cut the corner off to create a “pastry bag” so you can pipe the mixture into the yolks easily. Next, add a small piece of bacon to each egg, and then a slice of jalapeno.?#&amp;?#&amp;These are a great appetizer to bring to a party, especially for the Super Bowl!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine olive oil, lemongrass/or zest, cilantro, garlic, turmeric, sea salt and pepper in the food processor and pulse until uniformly mixed. You’re looking to make a seasoning “paste”. Next, reserve about 2 tbsp of the marinade to drizzle before serving. Marinate the chicken wings for 30 minutes before putting on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for medium direct heat at 350 degrees. I used my Green Mountain Grill Pellet Smoker and set it for 375 degrees with the smoker holes wide open. Grill your wings, turning halfway during the process, for approximately 15-18 minutes OR until the internal temperature has reached 170 degrees with an internal read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;The Chicken wings on the Green Mountain Grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once you’ve reached 170 degrees (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen to check internal temp), pull the wings off and drizzle with the remaining marinade. Prepare for out-of-this-world flavor combination! Enjoy.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing the tops and seeds of the jalapenos, wrap the cheese pieces with a piece of prosciutto. (Make sure to portion out the prosciutto so that there is enough for all the poppers.) After each piece of cheese is wrapped with a piece of prosciutto, stuff it inside the jalapeno as far as it will go. Repeat this process with all the poppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium direct heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the poppers for about eight minutes total, four minutes each side, or until nice char marks form and the cheese begins to melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pull off the grill and serve! These will be the hit of the party, guaranteed!?#&amp;?#&amp;Ready to pop in your mouth!?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Puree all marinade ingredients (soy sauce, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, fish sauce, oil, sugar and garlic) with a hand mixer or food processor until it forms a paste.?#&amp;Combine marinade and beef in a non-reactive container and marinate in the refrigerator for four hours.?#&amp;?#&amp;Thread the beef strips onto pre-soaked bamboo skewers.?#&amp;For the dipping sauce, combine all ingredients (sour cream, cilantro and lime juice) and refrigerate until ready to serve).?#&amp;Preheat a charcoal grill to medium-high heat, about 350-400 degrees.?#&amp;Grill the skewers for three minutes on each side or until char marks form. These are thin slices of meat so they don’t need much time on the grill.?#&amp;Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Make Thai peanut sauce by combining all the ingredients and simmering on the stove. Once the sauce has cooled, marinate the chicken pieces in 1 cup of sauce for 20 minutes. Next, quarter the Vidalia onions and slice the zucchini. Skewer the chicken, Vidalia onion (about three layers thick of onion) and zucchini alternating ingredients on the skewer.?#&amp;?#&amp;&#160;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees, about medium heat. Grill the skewers for seven minutes or until an internal read thermometer registers 170 degrees for the chicken.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve the skewers with rice and additional Thai Peanut sauce for dipping. The Thai Peanut sauce is great for flavoring the rice and is quite addictive.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill. Sprinkle with smoked paprika for color then drizzle with sauce before serving.</Data></Cell>

The outer filets will remove pretty cleanly for serving but be extra vigilant about looking for bones before serving guests.</Data></Cell>

While cooking in the oven, the cake will expand much more and gain volume on the top that will eventually go back down as the cake continues to cook.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove from the oven and let cool on the counter for 20 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator and let the cake cool for a few hours until ready to serve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill. Sprinkle with smoked paprika for color then drizzle with sauce before serving.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill. Sprinkle with smoked paprika for color then drizzle with sauce before serving.</Data></Cell>

If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill. Sprinkle with smoked paprika for color then drizzle with sauce before serving.</Data></Cell>

If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill. Sprinkle with smoked paprika for color then drizzle with sauce before serving.</Data></Cell>

If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill. Sprinkle with smoked paprika for color then drizzle with sauce before serving.</Data></Cell>

If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Let chicken wings cook for about 25 minutes, then crank the smoker to 400 to get crispy skin. Use a thermapen or an internal read thermometer (if you use the Green Mountain Grill it comes with its own thermometer and it will tell you! I love that about this grill!) to test internal temperature – once the wings have reached an internal temperature of 170, pull them off the grill.

If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Prepared to be surprised how quickly your kids will eat their veggies with this sweet and savory dish!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a large pot with warm water. Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat. I live to serve my steaks with a compound butter because for some reason, steak and butter are a really great combo!?#&amp;?#&amp;How do you like to cook your steaks on the grill??#&amp;?#&amp;Leave a comment below to share your tips with other readers!</Data></Cell>

If your sprouts are still on the stalk, place it directly on the cooking grate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Your sprouts will take about 20 minutes to cook, though a bit faster if you have par-cooked them. Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a large pot with warm water. Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat. I live to serve my steaks with a compound butter because for some reason, steak and butter are a really great combo!?#&amp;?#&amp;How do you like to cook your steaks on the grill??#&amp;?#&amp;Leave a comment below to share your tips with other readers!</Data></Cell>

If your sprouts are still on the stalk, place it directly on the cooking grate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Your sprouts will take about 20 minutes to cook, though a bit faster if you have par-cooked them. Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat. I live to serve my steaks with a compound butter because for some reason, steak and butter are a really great combo!?#&amp;?#&amp;How do you like to cook your steaks on the grill??#&amp;?#&amp;Leave a comment below to share your tips with other readers!</Data></Cell>

If your sprouts are still on the stalk, place it directly on the cooking grate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Your sprouts will take about 20 minutes to cook, though a bit faster if you have par-cooked them. Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night. Reserve remaining chicken for dinner on night #2 and #3.?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 1: Chicken and Simple Arugula Salad?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you eat carbs, you can easily throw in a grilled Texas Toast or bread to round out the mail.&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 2: Chicken Tacos?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Reheat about 5-7 chicken thighs and tortillas in the toaster oven at 325. Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat. I live to serve my steaks with a compound butter because for some reason, steak and butter are a really great combo!?#&amp;?#&amp;How do you like to cook your steaks on the grill??#&amp;?#&amp;Leave a comment below to share your tips with other readers!</Data></Cell>

If your sprouts are still on the stalk, place it directly on the cooking grate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Your sprouts will take about 20 minutes to cook, though a bit faster if you have par-cooked them. Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

Save any remaining lemon and lime slices for serving with the fish once it’s cooked.?#&amp;?#&amp;3) Place the snapper on a frog mat and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees- this will take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour depending on the size of the fish.?#&amp;?#&amp;4) Once the internal temp has been met, remove and serve immediately with remaining lemon and lime slices. The outer filets will remove pretty cleanly for serving but be extra vigilant about looking for bones before serving guests.</Data></Cell>

If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night.

Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat. I live to serve my steaks with a compound butter because for some reason, steak and butter are a really great combo!?#&amp;?#&amp;How do you like to cook your steaks on the grill??#&amp;?#&amp;Leave a comment below to share your tips with other readers!</Data></Cell>

Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;1) Drizzle the insides of the snapper first with olive oil, then add the salt, pepper and garlic and spread in the inside of the cavity evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;2) layer lemon and lime slices in the cavity starting from front to back and then add the thyme sprigs in the cavity. Save any remaining lemon and lime slices for serving with the fish once it’s cooked.?#&amp;?#&amp;3) Place the snapper on a frog mat and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees- this will take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour depending on the size of the fish.?#&amp;?#&amp;4) Once the internal temp has been met, remove and serve immediately with remaining lemon and lime slices. The outer filets will remove pretty cleanly for serving but be extra vigilant about looking for bones before serving guests.</Data></Cell>

If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night.

Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat. I live to serve my steaks with a compound butter because for some reason, steak and butter are a really great combo!?#&amp;?#&amp;How do you like to cook your steaks on the grill??#&amp;?#&amp;Leave a comment below to share your tips with other readers!</Data></Cell>

Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;1) Drizzle the insides of the snapper first with olive oil, then add the salt, pepper and garlic and spread in the inside of the cavity evenly.?#&amp;?#&amp;2) layer lemon and lime slices in the cavity starting from front to back and then add the thyme sprigs in the cavity. Save any remaining lemon and lime slices for serving with the fish once it’s cooked.?#&amp;?#&amp;3) Place the snapper on a frog mat and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees- this will take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour depending on the size of the fish.?#&amp;?#&amp;4) Once the internal temp has been met, remove and serve immediately with remaining lemon and lime slices. The outer filets will remove pretty cleanly for serving but be extra vigilant about looking for bones before serving guests.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions For Grilled Chicken:?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill your grill with Kingsford Charcoal Briquettes and prepare your grill for direct heat (charcoal spread out evenly on the bottom versus only on one side). If you would like to learn about how to start a charcoal grill or how to create direct and indirect zones on your grill they are part of my GRILL SCHOOL series which will teach you the fundamentals of grilling!?#&amp;?#&amp;Oil your grill grates with avocado oil or another high heat oil so your chicken doesn’t stick. Grill the chicken thighs on direct heat until the internal temperature reads 170 degrees as determined by an instant read thermometer like the Thermapen or the Thermopop.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let rest before cutting into it. Serve with arugula salad and sliced heirloom tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic glaze and olive oil on the first night.

Serve with chopped cilantro, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes with your favorite hot sauce.&#160;Notes: Add black beans and rice to round out the meal if you have bigger appetites- this can be made in advance with canned beans and rice done in your rice cooker.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto/Low Carb: Opt for low car tortillas OR use lettuce as your tortilla and pair with full fat sour cream?#&amp;Paleo: Opt for grain free tortillas, such as almond, coconut or cassava tortillas from Siete foods, pair with coconut cream instead of sour cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Night 3: Cajun Chicken Alfredo&#160;?#&amp;?#&amp;Directions:?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil noodles or pan fry your noodles until they are aldente. Meanwhile, make your sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt butter, and cream until it begins to simmer. Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast. The taste won’t be exactly the same but it will still be good. If you still use some parm it will be “paleoish” and still taste great!</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat. I live to serve my steaks with a compound butter because for some reason, steak and butter are a really great combo!?#&amp;?#&amp;How do you like to cook your steaks on the grill??#&amp;?#&amp;Leave a comment below to share your tips with other readers!</Data></Cell>

Oddly, the frozen sprouts take about the same time as the thawed. Check them every 4 or 5 minutes and give them a stir. For on-the-stalk sprouts, give them a &#188; turn at each check, or as needed until you’ve cooked the sprouts all the way around. Cook until they reach an internal temperature of 165&#176;F.

This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

Save any remaining lemon and lime slices for serving with the fish once it’s cooked.?#&amp;?#&amp;3) Place the snapper on a frog mat and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees- this will take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour depending on the size of the fish.?#&amp;?#&amp;4) Once the internal temp has been met, remove and serve immediately with remaining lemon and lime slices. The outer filets will remove pretty cleanly for serving but be extra vigilant about looking for bones before serving guests.</Data></Cell>

Add the parmesan and let it continue to cook until the parm has melted.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add a tsp or more to taste of your favorite cajun seasoning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keto: Your’e good to go- Alfredo sauce is naturally Keto (but pasta is not!) You’ll want to use zoodles or mirarcle noodles to be Keto, Low Carb or Paleo.?#&amp;Paleo: You’re going to need to swap the cream with a nut milk and switch the Parmesan with nutritional yeast.

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped. Depending on the thickness of your steaks, get your coals started for DIRECT GRILLING (over the coals).&#160; At about 500 degrees so that you can start grilling once your Sous Vide Timer goes off.?#&amp;Since you have already cooked the steaks to the desired internal temperature of your liking, you are just finishing the steaks on the grill to achieve a nice sear on both sides.?#&amp;Grill your steaks at 2 minutes per side and test the internal doneness. If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat.

This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily. This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped.

If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat.

(See notes below for a fantastic all-purpose brine recipe.)?#&amp;In a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, herbs, salt, pepper, and lemon juice with an immersion blender.?#&amp;Next, lay the turkey out on a big cutting board or plate and spread it out. Slide your fingers under the skin and separate it from the meat for placement of butter. Slather butter underneath the breast, legs, etc- anywhere you can get butter underneath the skin- this is what is going to keep it moist (this is the least fun part but the results are worth it!).?#&amp;Heat your grill to 350 degrees, creating a direct and indirect zone. Grill the turkey on the indirect side, flipping halfway through, until an internal read thermometer reads a 160 degrees internal temp in the breast. This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily. This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped.

If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat.

(See notes below for a fantastic all-purpose brine recipe.)?#&amp;In a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, herbs, salt, pepper, and lemon juice with an immersion blender.?#&amp;Next, lay the turkey out on a big cutting board or plate and spread it out. Slide your fingers under the skin and separate it from the meat for placement of butter. Slather butter underneath the breast, legs, etc- anywhere you can get butter underneath the skin- this is what is going to keep it moist (this is the least fun part but the results are worth it!).?#&amp;Heat your grill to 350 degrees, creating a direct and indirect zone. Grill the turkey on the indirect side, flipping halfway through, until an internal read thermometer reads a 160 degrees internal temp in the breast. This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily. This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

Next, add salt and pepper to your steaks.?#&amp;Put the steaks in the vacuum bag or ziplock bag and add the butter and rosemary sprigs on top of each steak.?#&amp;Set your sous vide according to cut of steak and thickness. Please note that you will want to set them for about 10 degrees under your desired internal temperature as you will be finishing them off on the grill. So, if you want a medium rare steak at completion, set your Sous Vide to get to 125 internal degrees. Make sure your steaks are sealed in the plastic bag or vacuum bag and that they submerge in the water. I use a smaller pot to weigh down the steaks so they don’t float to the top.?#&amp;Cook the steaks according to the sous vide instructions and with the timer.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the Steaks are cooking in the Sous Vide?#&amp;?#&amp;Go ahead and get your grill prepped.

If you are looking for medium rare, opt to cook in the Sous Vide until 125. Then grill until you’ve hit internal temp 130 degrees. Keep in mind that when you pull the steak off the grill it will continue to come up about 5 degrees.?#&amp;I recommend you ALWAYS use a Thermapen, a Thermopop or an instant read thermometer so you don’t have to guess!?#&amp;Let the steaks rest under foil for 8 minutes or so, giving the juices a chance to re-distribute in the meat.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;If brining, brine overnight and then pat dry. (See notes below for a fantastic all-purpose brine recipe.)?#&amp;In a small mixing bowl, combine the butter, herbs, salt, pepper, and lemon juice with an immersion blender.?#&amp;Next, lay the turkey out on a big cutting board or plate and spread it out. Slide your fingers under the skin and separate it from the meat for placement of butter. Slather butter underneath the breast, legs, etc- anywhere you can get butter underneath the skin- this is what is going to keep it moist (this is the least fun part but the results are worth it!).?#&amp;Heat your grill to 350 degrees, creating a direct and indirect zone. Grill the turkey on the indirect side, flipping halfway through, until an internal read thermometer reads a 160 degrees internal temp in the breast. This will take approximately 2 hours or more depending on the size of your turkey.?#&amp;Next, finish the turkey on the direct side to achieve grill marks and crisp the skin, flipping halfway through, until an internal temp thermometer reads 170 degrees; this will be another 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of your bird.?#&amp;Remove the turkey from the grill and tent under foil for 10 minutes to let the juices re-absorb. Serve with your favorite sides and prepare to be amazed at the juicy results!?#&amp;?#&amp;All-Purpose Brine Recipe?#&amp;?#&amp;This versatile brine recipe can be used on pork, chicken and even fish. You can customize and make your own. Brining is recommended for cuts of meat that benefit from extra moisture, lean cuts that can dry out easily. This is enough brine for a pork shoulder, pork loin, or a whole chicken or turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep Time: 10 minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook Time: 5 Minutes?#&amp;?#&amp;10 cups water?#&amp;&#190; cup sea salt?#&amp;&#189; cup sugar?#&amp;4 sprigs rosemary?#&amp;2 tbsp black peppercorns?#&amp;2 bay leaves Orange rind (optional)?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all ingredients in a pot and let simmer for 5 minutes, just long enough to let the salt and sugar dissolve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;To begin cooking extravaganza trim away any excess fat from the goat leg. Expose as much of the meat as possible the set it aside. Goat can be a rather tough meat if prepared incorrectly. The best way to tenderize the meat is a good brine. Take the first 2 bottles of Guinness and pour them into a small stock pot. Open the 3rd bottle and enjoy. Add the 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt to the Guinness and simmer until dissolved. Add 3 cups of water to the mixture and allow it to cool. Place the goat leg in a container large enough that it can lay flat and pour the Guinness brine over the leg.&#160; Leave in the brine for 3-5 hours rotating the leg every 30 mins. While we brine the leg…may as well have that other bottle of Guinness.?#&amp;?#&amp;This would also be a great time to start working on the next step – BACON WEAVNG. Take a large sheet of aluminum foil (Large enough to cover the goat leg) and begin weaving. Think back to elementary school and making mats out of construction paper….it is the same, but with tasty, tasty bacon. If you aren’t a master bacon weaver, don’t worries you can lay out the bacon in overlapping strips.&#160; This would also be a good time to bring your smoker up to 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;After 3-5 hrs, remove the goat leg from the brine and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the entire leg down with the softened butter and minced garlic. Once rubbed down, sprinkle the shredded mint leaves over the leg. Now wrap the bacon around the leg. Make sure you leave no gaps…add more bacon. Now that it is happily wrapped in bacon wrap the leg in aluminum foil. Place the leg in the smoker and cook 12-14 hrs (depending on the size of the leg) at 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;Take a nap…have a drink or two, like Robyn’s Grilled Margaritas.?#&amp;?#&amp;An hour or so before the meat is done start working on your Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze and Blue Cheese Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze: Pour the wine into a medium sauce pan. Add the onion powder, garlic, cayenne and black pepper. Bring the mix to boil for 2-3 min then bring the heat down to a simmer for 10- 15 min.&#160; Remove from heat and set to the side.&#160; Pour yourself a glass or two of wine. It’s not too early is it??#&amp;?#&amp;Blue Cheese Sauce: Add the garlic, onions, and fire-roasted pepper to a large skillet and heat until the onions begin to sweat. Add the blue cheese and heavy cream to the mix and continue stirring until the cheese is blended smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now that the goat has been on for the 12-14 hours remove it from the smoker and allow it to rest 15 – 20 mins in the foil. Unwrap the foil and the bacon…but don’t discard the bacon…its bacon…eat it…It’s awesome. Pull the meat from the leg like you would a pork shoulder.&#160; Place the meat on toasted wheat rolls.&#160; Drizzle the cracked pepper wine glaze over the pulled goat.&#160; Spoon the blue cheese sauce over top of the meat. Add a piece of lettuce or spinach and Viola!&#160; Pour yourself a drink and Bon Appetite!”</Data></Cell>

It turned out great for this purpose).?#&amp;• Ham (I used applegate farms nitrate free ham- any boiled or glazed ham should work okay).?#&amp;• Dill pickles, thinkly sliced?#&amp;• 2 package sliced swiss cheese- enough slices to generously fill an entire loaf?#&amp;• Mustard- I used El Diablo Mango Mustard to add a little kick?#&amp;?#&amp;Tools:?#&amp;2 bricks covered in aluminum foil OR a large cast iron skillet</Data></Cell>

For serving a crowd or a tailgating party, slice into mini servings so people can grab and go.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;To begin cooking extravaganza trim away any excess fat from the goat leg. Expose as much of the meat as possible the set it aside. Goat can be a rather tough meat if prepared incorrectly. The best way to tenderize the meat is a good brine. Take the first 2 bottles of Guinness and pour them into a small stock pot. Open the 3rd bottle and enjoy. Add the 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt to the Guinness and simmer until dissolved. Add 3 cups of water to the mixture and allow it to cool. Place the goat leg in a container large enough that it can lay flat and pour the Guinness brine over the leg.&#160; Leave in the brine for 3-5 hours rotating the leg every 30 mins. While we brine the leg…may as well have that other bottle of Guinness.?#&amp;?#&amp;This would also be a great time to start working on the next step – BACON WEAVNG. Take a large sheet of aluminum foil (Large enough to cover the goat leg) and begin weaving. Think back to elementary school and making mats out of construction paper….it is the same, but with tasty, tasty bacon. If you aren’t a master bacon weaver, don’t worries you can lay out the bacon in overlapping strips.&#160; This would also be a good time to bring your smoker up to 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;After 3-5 hrs, remove the goat leg from the brine and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the entire leg down with the softened butter and minced garlic. Once rubbed down, sprinkle the shredded mint leaves over the leg. Now wrap the bacon around the leg. Make sure you leave no gaps…add more bacon. Now that it is happily wrapped in bacon wrap the leg in aluminum foil. Place the leg in the smoker and cook 12-14 hrs (depending on the size of the leg) at 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;Take a nap…have a drink or two, like Robyn’s Grilled Margaritas.?#&amp;?#&amp;An hour or so before the meat is done start working on your Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze and Blue Cheese Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze: Pour the wine into a medium sauce pan. Add the onion powder, garlic, cayenne and black pepper. Bring the mix to boil for 2-3 min then bring the heat down to a simmer for 10- 15 min.&#160; Remove from heat and set to the side.&#160; Pour yourself a glass or two of wine. It’s not too early is it??#&amp;?#&amp;Blue Cheese Sauce: Add the garlic, onions, and fire-roasted pepper to a large skillet and heat until the onions begin to sweat. Add the blue cheese and heavy cream to the mix and continue stirring until the cheese is blended smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now that the goat has been on for the 12-14 hours remove it from the smoker and allow it to rest 15 – 20 mins in the foil. Unwrap the foil and the bacon…but don’t discard the bacon…its bacon…eat it…It’s awesome. Pull the meat from the leg like you would a pork shoulder.&#160; Place the meat on toasted wheat rolls.&#160; Drizzle the cracked pepper wine glaze over the pulled goat.&#160; Spoon the blue cheese sauce over top of the meat. Add a piece of lettuce or spinach and Viola!&#160; Pour yourself a drink and Bon Appetite!”</Data></Cell>

It turned out great for this purpose).?#&amp;• Ham (I used applegate farms nitrate free ham- any boiled or glazed ham should work okay).?#&amp;• Dill pickles, thinkly sliced?#&amp;• 2 package sliced swiss cheese- enough slices to generously fill an entire loaf?#&amp;• Mustard- I used El Diablo Mango Mustard to add a little kick?#&amp;?#&amp;Tools:?#&amp;2 bricks covered in aluminum foil OR a large cast iron skillet</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;To begin cooking extravaganza trim away any excess fat from the goat leg. Expose as much of the meat as possible the set it aside. Goat can be a rather tough meat if prepared incorrectly. The best way to tenderize the meat is a good brine. Take the first 2 bottles of Guinness and pour them into a small stock pot. Open the 3rd bottle and enjoy. Add the 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt to the Guinness and simmer until dissolved. Add 3 cups of water to the mixture and allow it to cool. Place the goat leg in a container large enough that it can lay flat and pour the Guinness brine over the leg.&#160; Leave in the brine for 3-5 hours rotating the leg every 30 mins. While we brine the leg…may as well have that other bottle of Guinness.?#&amp;?#&amp;This would also be a great time to start working on the next step – BACON WEAVNG. Take a large sheet of aluminum foil (Large enough to cover the goat leg) and begin weaving. Think back to elementary school and making mats out of construction paper….it is the same, but with tasty, tasty bacon. If you aren’t a master bacon weaver, don’t worries you can lay out the bacon in overlapping strips.&#160; This would also be a good time to bring your smoker up to 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;After 3-5 hrs, remove the goat leg from the brine and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the entire leg down with the softened butter and minced garlic. Once rubbed down, sprinkle the shredded mint leaves over the leg. Now wrap the bacon around the leg. Make sure you leave no gaps…add more bacon. Now that it is happily wrapped in bacon wrap the leg in aluminum foil. Place the leg in the smoker and cook 12-14 hrs (depending on the size of the leg) at 225 degrees.?#&amp;?#&amp;Take a nap…have a drink or two, like Robyn’s Grilled Margaritas.?#&amp;?#&amp;An hour or so before the meat is done start working on your Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze and Blue Cheese Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze: Pour the wine into a medium sauce pan. Add the onion powder, garlic, cayenne and black pepper. Bring the mix to boil for 2-3 min then bring the heat down to a simmer for 10- 15 min.&#160; Remove from heat and set to the side.&#160; Pour yourself a glass or two of wine. It’s not too early is it??#&amp;?#&amp;Blue Cheese Sauce: Add the garlic, onions, and fire-roasted pepper to a large skillet and heat until the onions begin to sweat. Add the blue cheese and heavy cream to the mix and continue stirring until the cheese is blended smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now that the goat has been on for the 12-14 hours remove it from the smoker and allow it to rest 15 – 20 mins in the foil. Unwrap the foil and the bacon…but don’t discard the bacon…its bacon…eat it…It’s awesome. Pull the meat from the leg like you would a pork shoulder.&#160; Place the meat on toasted wheat rolls.&#160; Drizzle the cracked pepper wine glaze over the pulled goat.&#160; Spoon the blue cheese sauce over top of the meat. Add a piece of lettuce or spinach and Viola!&#160; Pour yourself a drink and Bon Appetite!”</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your Green Mountain Grill or your other grill to 350 degrees. While getting your grill heated up, finish slicing your veggies. One your grill is at temperature, put your veggies on. Check your veggies every so often to ensure they are not burning- the garlic and peppers will cook the quickest- don’t let the garlic burn, just put it on long enough to soften and get some smoke. As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender. Now, go ahead and add your additional ingredients: balsamic, olive oil, water, sea salt and pepper and the the basil leaves. Pulse the content with your immersion blender until it is pureed. Don’t over puree it, you want it to have the consistency of a fine salsa.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. Garnish with additional basil. Great served with grilled bread as an appetizer, also great for a light lunch. Goat cheese or sliced avocado are also a great addition for garnish!?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy being the creative cook on your block- I promise your friends and family will rave over this recipe!</Data></Cell>

Add the sausage and peppers and grill until the sausage has reached an internal temp of 140 degrees (I recommend the thermapen instant read thermometer for checking internal temps quickly) and the peppers have achieved nice char marks on both sides. Remove the sausage and peppers and let cool. Remove the shrimp from the skewers and then chop the peppers and sausage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, heat the quart of chicken broth + 2 cups of water in a big pot and bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of grits gradually over 2 minutes and stir constantly. Let the grits simmer for 30-40 minutes and stir constantly. After the grits and broth have cooked down, add milk and cook a minute more. Finish with salt, pepper and smoked paprika.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grits are cooking, heat pancetta in a cast iron skillet or saut&#233; pan. Cook until crispy and remove the pancetta. Now, bring the pan to medium heat and add the 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. Gradually add the flour, a tablespoon at a time, and stir with a whisk to get remove the lumps. Stir constantly while adding the flour. Let the gravy reduce down and stir constantly to remove any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;To serve, place a heaping ladle-full of grits in a bowl, add shrimp, sausage, peppers and bits of pancetta. Finish with a generous serving of gravy! ENJOY!! Goes great with a spicy Bloody Mary for a proper Southern Brunch. And, don’t forget the Hot Sauce!!!

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees. Create a direct and indirect heating zone (the tomatoes will be grilled direct, crostini indirect). Slice your tomatoes in half and drizzle them in a little olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the tomatoes &#160;until the form a nice char on both sides, this will take approximately 15 minutes (give or take), depending on your grill. Once your tomatoes are nice and charred, put them in a deep sauce pot and put them on the stove. Using an immersion blender, blend the tomatoes together. Next, add the chicken broth and remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth. Place the pot on low-medium heat so the soup will be warm for serving.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, take a baquette and make 1/2 inch or smaller slices. Coat them in olive oil on both sides. Grill the crostini on indirect heat until toasted, about 2 minutes each side. Remove from grill and layer crostini, cheese, meat, peppers, and arugula and repeat, sandwiching a crostini on each each. Stick a skewer in through the middle to keep the pieces together. Serve with the soup for a sassy presentation that is perfect for dipping in the soup!?#&amp;?#&amp;Alas, this is one of those recipes that I just made that turned out wonderfully. I love those redeeming recipes that come out so great, to make up for the ones that don’t. I hope you enjoy!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

Direct/indirect cooking zones can be created by moving charcoal to one side of the grill or turning 2 burners on/2 burners off on a gas grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the fire is heating up, briefly blend the San Marzano tomatoes with the garlic with a stick blender, or chop the garlic and add to the tomatoes and break them up with a fork.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, grill the Italian sausage and bell peppers until char marks have formed and the internal temperature of the sausage registers 145 degrees. Remove from the grill and once it has cooled, chop into small pieces to be used as a filling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, cover a cutting board with flour or corn meal. Roll out the dough into a medium-sized circle. Layer sausage, peppers, cheese and a small dollop of sauce and oregano onto the right side of the calzone dough, keeping the ingredients on only one side of the dough. Coat the outer edges of the dough with water and then fold the dough over onto the other side forming a half circle/pocket. Use a fork on the outer edges to help seal the edges together. Lightly brush the calzone with olive oil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, coat the grill grates generously with oil so the calzone does not stick (this is very important). Place the dough on the indirect side and grill, with the lid closed, until char marks form. Next, flip the calzone and let grill until char marks have formed on the other side and the dough has turned golden brown.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once nice char marks have been achieved and the dough is golden brown, remove from the grill. Finish by brushing with olive oil and grating a generous amount of Parmesan over the top.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees creating direct and indirect grilling zones (on a charcoal grill, this means pushing the coals to one side so, on a gas grill this means one burner on high/two off). By using the indirect heat side of the grill, it will simulate a “pizza oven”.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the grill is heating, slice the onions in medium thick rings. Next, oil the grill grates with canola oil so the onions and pizza will not stick.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill the onions on direct (on top of the coals or burner with gas on) heat for 4-5 minutes per side, or until they being to develop nice deep char marks. Baste the onions with balsamic vinegar as they grill to help them caramelize on the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the onions are done, pull them off and put them on a cutting board where they can cool. Once they cool, cut them into smaller pieces.. Meanwhile, roll out your pizza dough on a well-floured cutting board.?#&amp;?#&amp;Again, make sure your grill grates are well oiled so the dough will not stick. Place the dough on the grill grates on the indirect side of the grill and let it cook for 4-5 minutes or until char marks have formed on the under side and the bottom is beginning to brown. Flip the dough over to cook the other side for the same amount of time. Meanwhile, add the balsamic glaze as the “sauce” that forms the base of the pizza. Next, place tablespoon sized scoops of goat cheese all over the pizza. Next, add the grilled onions. Let the pizza “bake” with the lid on for 4 minutes or until the cheese has melted and char marks have formed on the bottom crust.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pizza and place on a large cutting board. Sprinkle with arugula for garnish. This is a great pizza as a standalone dish or is also great served in smaller servings as an appetizer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Recipe notes: I’ve made this recipe with both thin crust pizza dough and “Flat Out” brand flat breads. They both turned out great- in the case of the “Flat Outs”, they are thinner than pizza dough and will therefore cook faster on the grill.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;“I use a pre-made dough that comes from the frozen section at the grocery store. You simply let it get completely unfrozen in the refrigerator, and then start rolling it out when you’re ready to use it. You can make your own dough, but this is a cheap, easy and good tasting result.?#&amp;?#&amp;Use a dough knife to cut the dough into six pieces that, when stretched, made little pies about three inches across.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush them lightly on both sides with olive oil, and just drop them onto a raging hot grill. It won’t take but about two minutes to cook on one side, so watch them carefully. At this point, REMOVE THE CRUSTS FROM THE GRILL WITHOUT COOKING THE OTHER SIDE!!!!!?#&amp;?#&amp;The other side will cook once you have added your toppings. If you cook it now, it will burn later.?#&amp;?#&amp;The fun part is adding toppings that match your team and the away team.?#&amp;?#&amp;We found a perfect orange pepper and an orange tomato, and added alfredo sauce and cheddar cheese for the Tennessee pizza. For the Red and Black, we used a red pepper, red pizza sauce, pepperonis and black olives. Place the toppings on the side you already grilled, and place the mini pizzas, uncooked side down, onto a baking sheet or pizza pan back on the grill. Close the top so that the toppings can brown and the cheese can melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;When they are almost done, slip them off the sheet pan and directly onto the grill just long enough to get grill lines. It should only take about 1 minute.?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy!!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a grill for medium heat, about 350 degrees, with two zones- direct and indirect (fire/no fire- on a charcoal grill this means the coals are on one side, on a gas grill this means that you have on side of the grill turned on to medium high, the other side turned off).?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare the pork loin filet by slicing it in half, keeping each piece as similar in size as possible so it cooks more evenly (one end of the loin filet will be smaller in diameter). Oil your grill grates with a high temperature cooking oil so the pork does not stick. Next, Grill the pork loin on direct heat until it reaches 145 degrees internal temperature (I recommend using an instant read thermometer such as the thermapen to check internal temps). If the pork is cooking too quickly on the outside but is still not to temp on the inside, place the filets on indirect heat to continue to cook until 145 degrees internal temp has been reached.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pork loin and let it rest under foil. Next, grill the onion “rings” until char marks have formed on both sides. Remove and let cool. Slice the pork thinly into bitesized pieces, and then chop the grilled onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flatbread pizzas bake on indirect heat on the grill for 8-10 minutes until they become crispy and the cheese has melted. After you pull it off the grill, top with arugula?#&amp;On a large platter or cutting board, Layer two flatbreads on top of each other making two pizzas. Layer goat cheese crumbles, onion, and pork on the pizzas. Drizzle with balsamic glaze. Use a large spatula or pick up the pizzas and lay them on the INDIRECT side of the grill and let them bake until the cheese has begun and the flat breads begin to brown and get crispy and firm, approximately 8-10 minutes. Remove from the grill and place on a cutting board and layer arugula onto each pizza and drizzle more balsamic glaze over the pizzas. Slice into small pieces, approximately 6 each pizza. These are awesome for dinner but are equally awesome as an appetizer!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat your grill to 350 degrees creating direct and indirect grilling zones (on a charcoal grill, this means pushing the coals to one side so, on a gas grill this means one burner on high/two off).

Once they cool, cut them into smaller pieces.. Meanwhile, roll out your pizza dough on a well-floured cutting board.?#&amp;?#&amp;Again, make sure your grill grates are well oiled so the dough will not stick. Place the dough on the grill grates on the indirect side of the grill and let it cook for 4-5 minutes or until char marks have formed on the under side and the bottom is beginning to brown. Flip the dough over to cook the other side for the same amount of time. Meanwhile, add the balsamic glaze as the “sauce” that forms the base of the pizza. Next, place tablespoon sized scoops of goat cheese all over the pizza. Next, add the grilled onions. Let the pizza “bake” with the lid on for 4 minutes or until the cheese has melted and char marks have formed on the bottom crust.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pizza and place on a large cutting board. Sprinkle with arugula for garnish. This is a great pizza as a standalone dish or is also great served in smaller servings as an appetizer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Recipe notes: I’ve made this recipe with both thin crust pizza dough and “Flat Out” brand flat breads. They both turned out great- in the case of the “Flat Outs”, they are thinner than pizza dough and will therefore cook faster on the grill.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;“I use a pre-made dough that comes from the frozen section at the grocery store. You simply let it get completely unfrozen in the refrigerator, and then start rolling it out when you’re ready to use it. You can make your own dough, but this is a cheap, easy and good tasting result.?#&amp;?#&amp;Use a dough knife to cut the dough into six pieces that, when stretched, made little pies about three inches across.?#&amp;?#&amp;Brush them lightly on both sides with olive oil, and just drop them onto a raging hot grill. It won’t take but about two minutes to cook on one side, so watch them carefully. At this point, REMOVE THE CRUSTS FROM THE GRILL WITHOUT COOKING THE OTHER SIDE!!!!!?#&amp;?#&amp;The other side will cook once you have added your toppings. If you cook it now, it will burn later.?#&amp;?#&amp;The fun part is adding toppings that match your team and the away team.?#&amp;?#&amp;We found a perfect orange pepper and an orange tomato, and added alfredo sauce and cheddar cheese for the Tennessee pizza. For the Red and Black, we used a red pepper, red pizza sauce, pepperonis and black olives. Place the toppings on the side you already grilled, and place the mini pizzas, uncooked side down, onto a baking sheet or pizza pan back on the grill. Close the top so that the toppings can brown and the cheese can melt.?#&amp;?#&amp;When they are almost done, slip them off the sheet pan and directly onto the grill just long enough to get grill lines. It should only take about 1 minute.?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy!!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Create a fire in your grill for medium direct heat. Make sure you use enough coals and they are evenly lit- you will be roasting the pumpkins in the coals.?#&amp;?#&amp;Roast the pumpkins in the coals for 30-45 minutes, making sure that the pumpkins are uniformly surrounded by charcoal so they cook evenly. Pumpkins are ready to be removed once you can easily remove with a form.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pumpkins (using tongs or heat proof gloves) and let cool. Split open and remove seeds. Add arugula and goat cheese. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze; add salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful with the addition of pecans and dried cherries. What is neat is the half pumpkin makes for a cool serving vehicle for the rest of the ingredients- like a salad bowl. Other winter squshes can be used for this technique- I’ve done this with acorn squash and it was excellent! This recipe is perfect for a Holiday gathering! Do you have a cool way to serve pumpkin?

Add the rub or curry/salt/pepper to the mix and let marinate for a few minutes. Then, grill the chicken for 5-7 minutes or until the chicken has reached an internal temp of 170 degrees. Pull the chicken off the grill and let rest while you finish up inside.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the chicken is grilling, use a vegetable peeler to create zucchini noodles. You will first need to get some of the skin off and if you “square off” the zucchini- ie, create 4 sides to it, it will be easier to get more usable “noodles” from it. Add the coconut cream with the salt/pepper and lemongrass oil and toss until all the noodles are covered in the coconut milk mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Chop the basil and add to the noodles. Chop the chicken and add to the noodles. Toss everything together one more time. Enjoy the fragrance of the coconut milk, curry, basil and lemon grass coming together in this flavorful “pasta”. This pairs beautifully with a nice Sauvignon Blanc.</Data></Cell>

Because of the grilled romaine, there isn’t much need for dressing as the grilling gives it so much flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bon Appetit!!!</Data></Cell>

Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

Next, combine the next ingredients with an immersion blender to form a seasoning paste. Using your index finger, gently separate the skin from the muscle, being careful not to tear the skin. Now, slather the seasoning paste generously under and over the skin of the quail. Let the quail marinate in the fridge for at least an hour before grilling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for 350 degrees, direct heat (ie, over the coals/gas). Oil your grill grates with canola or vegetable oil so your quail will not stick to the grill grates- don’t forget this step, Very Important! Grill the quail for 6-8 minutes PER SIDE or until an internal read thermometer reads 170 degrees. Remove the quail and let rest under foil for 10 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pair with your favorite sides!

Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

Let the quail marinate in the fridge for at least an hour before grilling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for 350 degrees, direct heat (ie, over the coals/gas). Oil your grill grates with canola or vegetable oil so your quail will not stick to the grill grates- don’t forget this step, Very Important!

Apply the rub and smoke the meat for 2 hours.?#&amp;After 2 hours, remove from the smoker and do the “Texas Crutch,” i.e., “wrap in foil”. Mix the apple juice and pineapple preserve and add to the foil packet. Let smoke another two hours.?#&amp;Meanwhile, as the meat is smoking make your rum barbecue sauce. Combine the BBQ sauce, pineapple preserves, rum, chopped pineapple, pineapple juice and allspice. Let reduce down for 20 minutes on medium simmer.?#&amp;During the last hour, remove the ribs from foil and glaze with the pineapple rum BBQ sauce.?#&amp;Layer slices of pineapple on top of the ribs and drizzle more sauce over the pineapple.?#&amp;Let smoke for an additional hour to let the sauce set.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the bison meat with the minced garlic and add the butter a dash of Worcestershire sauce (bison meat is lean so the butter adds fat= moisture). Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

Set your smoker to 225 degrees and then add your wood chips before adding the pork belly (I used Hickory but use what you like! I believe apply wood would be amazing!).?#&amp;Cook the pork belly fat side down. Smoke the pork belly until it reaches an internal temp of 150 degrees (use an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen). This only took me about 2-5 hours but it could take you longer. Expect 3 hours on your smoker, give or take.?#&amp;Let the pork belly cool. You can slice it up and cook it or keep it in the fridge for up to two weeks.?#&amp;I ate a LOT of bacon the week I made this. IN fact, I took the smoked pork belly and ground it in with burger meat to make extra-bacony bacon burgers! OMG!</Data></Cell>

With an immersion blender or stick blender, combine the tomatoes, roasted garlic and olive oil from the packet, and a large bunch of cilantro to form a salsa.?#&amp;Add a dash of salt, pepper and more olive oil as needed.

(You can combine the leftover dough and roll out to create more circles).?#&amp;Next, chop the skirt steak into small pieces. Add approximately 1+ tbsp. meat, and then finish with a tsp of the sauce onto one side of the dough circle.?#&amp;Roll the other side over and mash the ends together with the end of a fork to form a seal. Continue with the rest of the dough and filling, if they are too full to close, decrease the amount of filling.?#&amp;Once finished, prepare your grill for direct and indirect zones and a temp of 350 degrees. Or, you can also use an oven set to 350 degrees. Oil your grill grates and let the empanadas bake on indirect heat for approximately 20 minutes or until the dough becomes golden.</Data></Cell>

Let the quail marinate in the fridge for at least an hour before grilling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for 350 degrees, direct heat (ie, over the coals/gas). Oil your grill grates with canola or vegetable oil so your quail will not stick to the grill grates- don’t forget this step, Very Important!

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the bison meat with the minced garlic and add the butter a dash of Worcestershire sauce (bison meat is lean so the butter adds fat= moisture). Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

Set your smoker to 225 degrees and then add your wood chips before adding the pork belly (I used Hickory but use what you like! I believe apply wood would be amazing!).?#&amp;Cook the pork belly fat side down. Smoke the pork belly until it reaches an internal temp of 150 degrees (use an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen). This only took me about 2-5 hours but it could take you longer. Expect 3 hours on your smoker, give or take.?#&amp;Let the pork belly cool. You can slice it up and cook it or keep it in the fridge for up to two weeks.?#&amp;I ate a LOT of bacon the week I made this. IN fact, I took the smoked pork belly and ground it in with burger meat to make extra-bacony bacon burgers! OMG!</Data></Cell>

With an immersion blender or stick blender, combine the tomatoes, roasted garlic and olive oil from the packet, and a large bunch of cilantro to form a salsa.?#&amp;Add a dash of salt, pepper and more olive oil as needed.

(You can combine the leftover dough and roll out to create more circles).?#&amp;Next, chop the skirt steak into small pieces. Add approximately 1+ tbsp. meat, and then finish with a tsp of the sauce onto one side of the dough circle.?#&amp;Roll the other side over and mash the ends together with the end of a fork to form a seal. Continue with the rest of the dough and filling, if they are too full to close, decrease the amount of filling.?#&amp;Once finished, prepare your grill for direct and indirect zones and a temp of 350 degrees. Or, you can also use an oven set to 350 degrees. Oil your grill grates and let the empanadas bake on indirect heat for approximately 20 minutes or until the dough becomes golden.</Data></Cell>

Now, slather the seasoning paste generously under and over the skin of the quail. Let the quail marinate in the fridge for at least an hour before grilling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for 350 degrees, direct heat (ie, over the coals/gas). Oil your grill grates with canola or vegetable oil so your quail will not stick to the grill grates- don’t forget this step, Very Important! Grill the quail for 6-8 minutes PER SIDE or until an internal read thermometer reads 170 degrees. Remove the quail and let rest under foil for 10 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pair with your favorite sides!

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the bison meat with the minced garlic and add the butter a dash of Worcestershire sauce (bison meat is lean so the butter adds fat= moisture). Form the meat into 8 burgers. With your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of the burger- this will help the burger cook evenly. Coat each burger with approximately &#189;-1tsp.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, prepare your grill for medium heat, 350 degrees- creating a direct and indirect zone (coals on one side).While the grill is heating up, slice the onion into thin slices. Take 2 large pieces of foil as a double layer and create a “hobo packet” where you create a packet that is sealed on all sides that will cook the onions on the grill. Before sealing the foil packet, add the sliced onions, 1 tbsp. of cider vinegar and &#189; cup of BBQ Sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, oil your grill grates so your meat does not stick, then place your burgers and the hobo packet on direct heat. If your burgers are cooking too quickly you can put them indirect so they continue to cook without getting burned. Cook until the internal temperate reads 140 degrees for medium burgers, (I recommend using an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen) flipping halfway through. When the burgers are getting almost done, add the cheese to the burgers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, place the sliced buns on the indirect side and let them toast on the grill for a few minutes. Pull off the hobo packet at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble your burger:?#&amp;?#&amp;Place your burger on the toasted bun and add bacon, pickles and a giant heap of BBQ sauce caramelized onions, plus a little extra sauce to the burger. Prepare for burger ecstasy! If you want some greens on your burger, a little peppery arugula is perfect.</Data></Cell>

On the 7th day, remove the pork belly from the fridge and rinse the rub off.?#&amp;Now soak the pork belly in the fridge for an hour before cooking it so it’s not too salty.?#&amp;For this recipe I used my Big Green Egg, but any smoker will do. Set your smoker to 225 degrees and then add your wood chips before adding the pork belly (I used Hickory but use what you like! I believe apply wood would be amazing!).?#&amp;Cook the pork belly fat side down. Smoke the pork belly until it reaches an internal temp of 150 degrees (use an internal read thermometer such as the Thermapen). This only took me about 2-5 hours but it could take you longer. Expect 3 hours on your smoker, give or take.?#&amp;Let the pork belly cool. You can slice it up and cook it or keep it in the fridge for up to two weeks.?#&amp;I ate a LOT of bacon the week I made this. IN fact, I took the smoked pork belly and ground it in with burger meat to make extra-bacony bacon burgers! OMG!</Data></Cell>

With an immersion blender or stick blender, combine the tomatoes, roasted garlic and olive oil from the packet, and a large bunch of cilantro to form a salsa.?#&amp;Add a dash of salt, pepper and more olive oil as needed. It should form a thick paste which will top the meat in the empanadas.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stuff?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, roll out your pie dough on a large piece of parchment paper and flour it so it does not stick. Do not leave the dough out more than 10 minutes or it will get sticky and hard to work with.?#&amp;With a medium sized bowl, cut the dough into circle shaped disks- approximately 6 inches from side to side. (You can combine the leftover dough and roll out to create more circles).?#&amp;Next, chop the skirt steak into small pieces. Add approximately 1+ tbsp. meat, and then finish with a tsp of the sauce onto one side of the dough circle.?#&amp;Roll the other side over and mash the ends together with the end of a fork to form a seal. Continue with the rest of the dough and filling, if they are too full to close, decrease the amount of filling.?#&amp;Once finished, prepare your grill for direct and indirect zones and a temp of 350 degrees. Or, you can also use an oven set to 350 degrees. Oil your grill grates and let the empanadas bake on indirect heat for approximately 20 minutes or until the dough becomes golden.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Instructions?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the backbone of the quail in half so you can spread the birds flat on the grill. Next, combine the next ingredients with an immersion blender to form a seasoning paste. Using your index finger, gently separate the skin from the muscle, being careful not to tear the skin. Now, slather the seasoning paste generously under and over the skin of the quail. Let the quail marinate in the fridge for at least an hour before grilling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare your grill for 350 degrees, direct heat (ie, over the coals/gas). Oil your grill grates with canola or vegetable oil so your quail will not stick to the grill grates- don’t forget this step, Very Important! Grill the quail for 6-8 minutes PER SIDE or until an internal read thermometer reads 170 degrees. Remove the quail and let rest under foil for 10 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pair with your favorite sides! This recipe is perfect for date night or having friends over- the quail are so pretty on the plate and they grill up in no time!</Data></Cell>
