<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The ingredient ratios are pretty flexible with this recipe. Start with 1 pint (470 mL) Greek-style yogurt, 2 cloves garlic, 1 medium cucumber (we&#39;ll actually only use half a cucumber), 1 tablespoon (15 mL) red wine vinegar, and 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Anghelika says her grandmother kept telling her to make sure to remember the vinegar (as if it was the secret to her tsatsiki recipe).?#&amp;?#&amp;The amount of garlic used in this recipe is up to the individual&#39;s taste. I suggest starting with the two cloves and adjusting to taste when you make tsatsiki in the future.?#&amp;?#&amp;Peel the garlic cloves and cut off the woody ends. Pulverizing the cloves as best as you can. You can mince the garlic with a knife, rub it with the tings of a fork, run it through a garlic press, or use a zester (shown in the picture).?#&amp;?#&amp;Peel the cucumber. Split the cucumber in half (cut crosswise) and then again along the length of the cucumber to expose the seeds. A teaspoon or similar implement can then be used to scrape out the seeds. Whenever I work with cucumbers, I always cut a little bit and taste it before I add it to a recipe. If a cucumber is old or not good quality, it can taste bitter instead of slightly sweet and refreshing. Using a cucumber like that can ruin a recipe pretty easily.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut up one half cucumber into small strips. You can use a coarse grater for this if you don&#39;t like fine knife work.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cucumbers contain a lot of water which we don&#39;t want to introduce to the Greek-style yogurt. (Greek-style yogurt or Bulgarian yogurt is strained to remove excess liquid, so it&#39;s a bit thicker than &quot;standard&quot; yogurt. It also tastes a bit different - the flavor seems closer to a really good sour cream than to plain Yoplait.) Take the chopped up cucumber and squeeze it. You can do this by placing it in a piece of cheesecloth and squeezing. My favorite method - squeeze it in your fist.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the drained cucumber to the garlic.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the garlic, cucumber, olive oil, and vinegar together. Stir it around a little to separate the little garlic and cucumber pieces.?#&amp;?#&amp;Put the yogurt in a container large enough to stir in the garlic and cucumber mixture without making a mess. I scooped the yogurt into a 1 quart container.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the garlic and cucumber mixture to the yogurt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir until everything is evenly distributed in the yogurt. Stir in salt to taste. I found that 1/4 teaspoon table salt was a good amount.?#&amp;?#&amp;This step is really important - refrigerate for at least a day. Right after mixing the yogurt, the tsatsiki is a bit runny and somewhat flavorless (it just tastes like the yogurt). After refrigerating for a day, the garlic flavor permeates the thickened tsatsiki.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This recipe is for a 10 to 14 pound turkey. I will update for larger turkeys later. (I rushed this recipe out after roasting a turkey in the wee hours of the morning, so everyone could get a head start on planning for their turkey dinner. I&#39;ll correct any mistakes I may have made after the weekend.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Brining?#&amp;?#&amp;Thanksgiving Dinner?#&amp;?#&amp;Turkey or Chicken Stock?#&amp;?#&amp;Giblet Pan Gravy?#&amp;?#&amp;Smoked Beer Can Turkey?#&amp;?#&amp;Before you even think about roasting the turkey, you&#39;ll need to budget enough time to thaw, brine, and dry the turkey. If you&#39;re purchasing a frozen turkey, allow at least 5 hours per pound of thawing time in the refrigerator. After the turkey has thawed, treat it as if it were fresh (for the purposes of this recipe). Remove the giblets and the neck (found inside the chest cavity). Prepare a brining solution of 1 cup table salt to 1 gallon water in a nonreactive container and soak the turkey in the solution in the refrigerator for four hours. (If your turkey has been infused with a solution, then reduce the salt content in your brine or soak it in a container filled with water.) Pour out the brining solution and rinse the turkey. One convenient way to do this is to position a rack in the sink and place the turkey on the rack to rinse. After the turkey has been rinsed, let it dry by placing it on a rack on a sheet pan in the refrigerator overnight (or for eight hours). Alternatively, use a blow drier on cool setting (no heat) to blow over the skin of the turkey until dry.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now that the turkey is ready to go, preheat your oven to 400&#176;F. Chop up two medium onions, five carrots, and two celery ribs. Also melt 3 tablespoons butter and set aside 2 tablespoons dried thyme (or two sprigs of fresh thyme). Quantity and even chopping is not that important for this recipe, so feel free to prepare these steps quickly to save time.?#&amp;?#&amp;From the chopped vegetables, take about half an onion, a carrot, and a half celery rib and combine them with about 1 tsp. thyme and a tablespoon of melted butter. Mix them until evenly distributed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Throw the prepared vegetables (from the previous step) inside the turkey. Now, tie up the turkey&#39;s wings and legs so they will cook evenly. Take a 5 foot (1.5 m) long piece of kitchen twine and tie the drumsticks together as shown.?#&amp;?#&amp;Loop the twine around the turkey and over the wings.?#&amp;?#&amp;At the head of the turkey, tie a knot over the flap of skin to hold everything in place.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the rest of vegetables and thyme in a roasting pan. If you don&#39;t have a roasting pan, you can use a disposable aluminum foil roasting pan from the supermarket. Pour one cup water into the pan and place a V Rack into the pan. Brush breast side of the turkey with butter. Place the turkey on the V rack with the breast side facing down. Brush the back with butter. Place in a 400&#176;F oven.?#&amp;?#&amp;We&#39;re roasting this turkey upside down (usually turkeys are roasted breast up) to cook the breasts at a slower rate. Starting breast side down, gives the legs a head start on cooking. This is desirable because drumsticks and thighs need to be cooked to a higher temperature (about 170&#176;F) in order to remove any trace of pink flesh. The breasts would become very dry and unpalatable if cooked to temperatures as high as the legs.?#&amp;?#&amp;After 45 minutes, remove the turkey from the oven and baste it with the juices from the roasting pan. I&#39;ve tried to come up with an easy way to do this without a turkey baster, but I was unable to. Use a turkey baster to reach in between the rungs of the rack and suck up some juices and squirt it over the turkey. Then rotate the turkey onto its side (with a leg sticking up) and brush some more butter on. Return to oven for fifteen more minutes, then baste again and rotate onto other side. Roast for fifteen minutes. Roasting the turkey on its sides lets the sides brown (for better presentation). If you don&#39;t care about even browning, you can skip these two rotations and jus</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">June 22, 2004 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">(and too nice of a guy to send Tina on a mayonnaise buying errand)?#&amp;All you need are two large egg yolks, 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt, a pinch of white pepper, and 1 cup oil. I ran out of lemon juice last night (I just keep running out of ingredients), so I used about 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of lime juice. I also froze the two large egg whites in ice cube trays for later use. For the oil, I used extra light olive oil because of its very faint (almost nonexistant) flavor and nutritional and health properties.?#&amp;?#&amp;I put the yolks, lemon juice, salt, and pepper into my mixing bowl and whisked until smooth and light. I then whisked the oil, a few drops at a time, into the mixture. I made sure the mixture was smooth and well integrated before pouring the next few drops of oil. The whisking will suspend the oil into the yolk mixture and adding the oil a little at a time will keep the mixture in a state of emulsion - which is what we want.?#&amp;?#&amp;After about 1/3 cup of oil has been whisked in, you can speed up the pouring a bit. Make sure the mixture is back in emulsion before pouring any more oil. Once all the oil has been whisked in, you have mayonnaise. This is a good time to add any extras, a spoonful of dijon mustard and extra salt and black pepper is usually what I add.?#&amp;?#&amp;Because handmade mayonnaise is mostly egg yolk, the mayonnaise will have a healthy yellow color. Store bought or machine made mayonnaise usually also contains egg whites which will lighten the color up as well as lighten up the flavor. Anything you don&#39;t use immediately, put it in a jar and refrigerate. It should hold for half a week to a week.?#&amp;You might note that I called both mayonnaise and vinaigrette dressing emulsions. But, a vinaigrette eventually seperates while mayonnaise maintains its state of emulsion. This is because of the egg yolks which contains a substance called lecithin (an emulsifier). You may have seen lecithin as part of the ingredient list of store bought ice cream and salad dressings. This substance when mixed with water (the lemon juice) and oil (the olive oil) helps hold the two together in suspension. Of course, if we kept mixing more and more oil into the mixture, we would eventually overwhelm the emulsifier and the whole emulsion would separate (at least that&#39;s what I&#39;m told, maybe one day I&#39;ll do it to see what happens when you mix in too much oil).</Data></Cell>

Pili pili is the name that was originally given to the African bird&#39;s eye chilli within the Mozambican community. When this spread to the surrounding areas, most notably South Africa, people began to call it peri peri (the name we know it by today)?#&amp;Mozambique has a rich cultural mix of local people, Indians (mainly from Goa) and Portuguese. This fusion of culture brought about very rich and spicy food dishes. Chillies are used in many of the meals and peri peri chicken is one the better known meals that spread across and have become a favourite in Southern Africa.?#&amp;The Process of making the marinade.?#&amp;There are many variations of this out there, but this is the way that our family made the peri peri marinade:?#&amp;2 to 6 African birds-eye red chillies (depending on heat required)?#&amp;Juice of one lemon (take out the pips but leave the pulp in)?#&amp;1/2 tsp of chilli powder?#&amp;1/2 tsp med curry powder?#&amp;1 tsp paprika powder?#&amp;1/2 cup oil?#&amp;5 cloves garlic?#&amp;1/4 cup tomato sauce (same as tomato ketchup)?#&amp;Salt and pepper?#&amp;1/2 tbsp dried oregano?#&amp;50 mL wine vinegar (red wine vinegar is best)?#&amp;Blend all ingredients until smooth and refrigerate until needed. You can see how the different cultures have had their say in this recipe.?#&amp;Some points to note?#&amp;You may not be able to get the African bird&#39;s eye chilli where you are. You can use the chillies that you find in you areas or shops. You would be better off going with the hotter chillies and just using less (this is what we did depending on who had joined us for food) I would always advise starting off with a little less chilli and adding more as opposed to the other way round.?#&amp;Preparing the chicken for the braai?#&amp;I find that it is best to do this the night before you are planning to have the BBQ (Braai).?#&amp;Many people like to cut up the chicken into pieces. Personally, I like my chickens whole. I like to spatchcock my chicken and then once cleaned, add it to a deep set container and cover with the marinade that you have just made. You can do this the on the day of the BBQ but I think that it tastes better when it has been left over night.?#&amp;If you want to get really fancy you can stab the chicken in the meaty bits like the breast and thighs as this will help get some of the marinade in there. Make sure that you cover the chicken when you have it in the fridge.?#&amp;Cooking the chicken?#&amp;It is time for the BBQ, you have a fire going and everything is ready for your feast. In Zimbabwe it is the men that cook the meat and the woman that make the salads and sadza or rice. Having a Braai (BBQ) has always been one of the best ways to spend a sunny afternoon. For red meats I love sadza but for this meal I like rice, if you have a rice cooker you can find out how to cook different types of rice from this article (http://www.twokitchenjunkies.com/rice-cooker-frequently-asked-questions/)?#&amp;There are a few things you need to make this meal work:?#&amp;The temperature of the BBQ - chicken needs to be cooked for a long time slowly for it to cook all the way through especially if you have whole chicken. Zimbabwean BBQ&#39;s tend to be large so that they hold a lot more charcoal or wood, this way you can move the coals around making hot spots (for steaks, etc. and cooler spots to cook the chicken.?#&amp;My second trick is to cheat a little bit, I like to microwave the chicken just before I put it on the fire. This starts the cooking process from the inside and gives you a bit of an advantage as it is already starting to cook when you add it to the fire.?#&amp;It is important to note that cooking it t</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The only ingredients needed are: 1 lb. asparagus, 1/4 cup (30 g) chopped almonds, one tablespoon (15 g) butter, salt, and pepper (and cayenne pepper, if desired). Wash and clean the asparagus, breaking off the hard fibrous parts of the stems, if necessary. If the almonds haven&#39;t been chopped up, then finely chop the almonds.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt 1 Tbs. butter in a large saut&#233; pan over medium heat. The pan should be large enough to hold all the asparagus later.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the butter has melted, cook the almonds in the butter until the butter and almonds have browned.?#&amp;?#&amp;If some spiciness is desired, add a little (or a lot) of cayenne powder as desired and stir it into the butter and almonds.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the asparagus to the saut&#233; pan. Season with salt and pepper. Then toss to coat with butter and almonds. Actually, you probably don&#39;t want to actually toss (or use the saute motion) as a mess will probably result. Just use a large silicone spatula or a wooden spoon and move the asparagus around while scooping the butter almonds up on top.?#&amp;?#&amp;The asparagus can then be cooked in the pan as long as you keep the asparagus spears moving. This takes about 6 to 8 minutes. The best way to check if they are done is to take a little bite of one of the spears. The asparagus should be crisp but without a raw taste. An alternative method is to pour a little water (1 to 2 Tbs.) into the pan and to cover and let it steam for two minutes. Then uncover and let the water evaporate while saut&#233;ing.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The only ingredients you need for this recipe are one pound of chocolate chips (both semi-sweet and dark work well), 4 Tbs. butter, and a 14 ounce (net weight) can of sweetened condensed milk (not evaporated milk). The chocolate chips can be replaced or blended with peanut butter chips for to make peanut butter fudge or chocolate-peanut fudge. (If you like peanut butter swirls, you&#39;ll need to melt the peanut butter chips separately and swirl them in later.) Note that one pound of chocolate chips is the same as three cups of chocolate chips - not two.?#&amp;?#&amp;This recipe is so easy, you can even do it in the microwave oven. Use a microwave oven safe bowl and microwave until the chocolate is glistening and begins to melt (be careful not to overheat in the microwave or the chocolate will burn). For the purposes of this article, I&#39;ll be using a bain-marie. Heating chocolate indirectly over the gentle heat of steam will make it more difficult to overheat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Throw the butter and chocolate chips into a medium metal bowl or double boiler. Pour the sweetened condensed milk on top.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Roasted Asparagus Spears?#&amp;?#&amp;Cutting Up Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Cheesecake, Plain New York Style?#&amp;?#&amp;Fill a small pot with about an inch of water and bring it to a boil. Once it begins to boil, reduce the heat so the water is barely simmering.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the metal bowl on top of the pot to make a bain-marie. (If you have a double boiler, by all means, use it instead.) Make sure the bottom of the bowl is suspended above the water level itself (it&#39;s best to check this when you first start bringing the water to a boil since working with cool water and an empty bowl is easier than steaming water and a boil filled with two pounds of fudge ingredients.) Make sure the water is gently releasing steam - accidentally allowing too much moisture to settle on your chocolate could cause it to seize resulting in clumping. In my experience, this particular recipe is fairly forgiving, so don&#39;t worry too much.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the ingredients are gently heating, butter an 8 in. square baking dish. I should mention a couple of tips here that may help with unmolding the fudge after it has set. Once the pan is buttered, lay two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment paper down onto the buttered surface. The sheets should be longer than the container (a little more than twelve inches should be fine) and should be laid down perpendicular to each other. The butter will help keep the plastic wrap in place while you pour the fudge and after the fudge is set, you can use the ends that overflow the container to lift out the fudge. In the following pictures, I just buttered the baking pan and had to work at it a little to unmold the fudge one section at a time.?#&amp;?#&amp;After a few minutes over the heat, start mixing the melting chocolate together with the melting butter. Keep alternating between mixing and heating until all the ingredients are blended together (use your spatula to scape down the sides of the bowl at least once). At this point, if you want to add fancy components (like chopped walnuts, peanut butter for swirling, etc.) do so.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the fudge into the baking dish. Use a spatula to scrape the bowl clean.?#&amp;?#&amp;Level the fudge with your spatula.?#&amp;?#&amp;I don&#39;t like putting hot items into my refrigerator, so I like to use an aluminum half sheet pan as a heat sink. Pour a little cold water into the pan and place the fudge in the middle of the pan. A few ice cubes will help keep the aluminum cool as it takes on heat from the bottom of the baking pan. After about ten minutes, slip the fudge into the refrigerator for chilling and setting.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the fudge has set, about two hours, cut into squares.?#&amp;This is a fun recipe to play with. Additional ingredients can be melted in or mixed in before pouring. Two different fudges (like chocolate and peanut butter or dark chocolate and white chocolate) can be made and poured on top of each</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">I adapted this recipe from Jeni&#39;s Splendid Ice Creams at Home. I found her recipe resulted in pralines that were more like candy with nuts than candied nuts, so I increased the quantity of chopped nuts to 1-1/2 cup (from 1 cup). If you&#39;d like more candy than nuts, then just reduce the nuts to 1 cup.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat oven to 350&#176;F (175&#176;C) and set a rack in the middle position.?#&amp;The ingredients you&#39;ll need are 2 tablespoons (42 g) honey, 2 tablespoons (28 g) light brown sugar, 1-1/2 cups (170 g) chopped pecans, 1 tablespoon (14 g) melted butter, and 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) table salt (not shown in photograph).?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine all the ingredients in a bowl. When I make this at home, I don&#39;t bother measuring all the ingredients into separate bowls (as I&#39;ve done here for the step-by-step photographs). It&#39;s faster to just weigh all the ingredients than to attempt to measure with dry and fluid measuring cups. I just put a bowl on a scale and measure out pecans and butter directly into it. If the butter needs to be melted, I microwave the pecans with butter for a few seconds until the pecans warm up and melt the butter after stirring. Then I put the bowl back on the scale and add the sugar, honey, and salt according to the reading on the scale. (I actually measure the salt separately since my main kitchen scale only has 1 g precision. Using a 1/4 teaspoon is faster than pulling out the precision scale.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir the ingredients until well coated.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place a sheet of parchment paper on a half sheet pan. (Aluminum foil also works, but don&#39;t use wax paper - the wax will melt and become part of the pralines. The result will still be edible, but not desirable.) Scoop the sugar, honey, and nuts mixture onto the parchment paper and spread out into a single layer. Place the sheet pan into the preheated oven and let it bake for 8 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;After the eight minutes have elapsed, remove the sheet pan. The sugar and honey mixture should be melted and bubbling forming a giant puddle of hot, sticky pecan and caramel.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using a heat resistant spatula, stir the candied nuts to evenly coat the nuts in the hot sugar syrup and spread it out again. Put the pan back in the oven for three more minutes, then stir it again. Place the pan back in the oven.?#&amp;?#&amp;After another three minutes, remove the pan. The pralines will have taken on a darker, richer color and will smell of candy and toasted nuts.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using your heat resistant spatula, spread the nuts out as much as possible and allow it to cool completely.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the pralines are cooled, pull the parchment paper together to form the pralines into a mound and to break up the larger chunks. Then break the individual pieces of pralines into smaller pieces. You can use a tool for this like a spoon or knife, but I find it easiest (and cleanest) to just use my hands.?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Butter Pecan Ice Cream?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicago 2011 Part 1a - Overview?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Condensed Milk Fudge?#&amp;?#&amp;Marshmallows?#&amp;?#&amp;Pralines are best eaten immediately or blended into just made ice cream, but can be kept without much deterioration by freezing them in an airtight container.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">When talking about fish, the term poaching is used most often for fish cooked in a simmering liquid where the liquid is intended to be discarded. Braising or stewing is often used when the liquid is to be served with the fish.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Pan Fried Fish Fillets?#&amp;?#&amp;Kitchen Thermometers?#&amp;?#&amp;Additives?#&amp;?#&amp;Ratatouille?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;The water used when poaching fish should be &quot;high quality&quot;. If you don&#39;t drink your tap water, then don&#39;t use it for this recipe. Use water that you would be willing to drink (and, hopefully, prefer the taste of) for this recipe because those off flavors will present themselves in the final dish if you use funny tasting water. Also, we&#39;re not going to boil the fish - we&#39;re going to cook it in near boiling temperature water. Boiling will cause unnecessary violent currents through the cooking liquid which will end up tearing apart the fish into little pieces instead of gently cooking them through. The poaching liquid can be used repeatedly for multiple batches of fish or other foods you may want to poach in a flavorful liquid - just bring it back to a boil between uses. (Use the poaching liquid all in one session and then discard... please don&#39;t keep a pot of poaching liquid sitting on your stove waiting for the next poached fish meal.)?#&amp;?#&amp;For this recipe, prepare the poaching liquid by filling a saute pan with enough water to measure a depth of about one inch (2.5 cm). Throw in a couple cloves of garlic, about 30 to 40 whole peppercorns, 4 sprigs of parsley, 1/2 cup dry white wine, and a bay leaf. Covering the saucepan, allow the mixture to come to a full boil and turn the heat down to low. We want to let the flavors of the spices infuse into the liquid, so let it sit on low for about twenty minutes. Feel free to use this time to prepare any side dishes you may want, like a rice pilaf.?#&amp;?#&amp;I find that tilapia, red snapper, and bass seem to work well when poached. But it greatly depends on the individual: the flavors of catfish may be pleasant to many, but I can&#39;t stand it when poached. Each fish has it&#39;s own flavors, so I encourage trying them out (in a restaurant or when they go on sale) and figuring out what flavors agree with your palate. Poaching is a great way to prepare fish for tasting, because the flavor of the fish is not overwhelmed by sauces or marinades.?#&amp;Bring the poaching liquid back up to a full rolling boil, then turn the heat back to the lowest setting. When the boil settles down, place the fillets into the liquid with a thin, flat, slotted spatula and cover for five minutes. (Filets thicker than 1 cm may need an additional minute or two.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the filets from the liquid and serve with some kosher salt sprinkled on top, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a few drained capers, and a couple slices of lemon on the side.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Start off with 1 Tbs. brown sugar, 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon, and a tart apple such as a Granny Smith variety. If you&#39;re preparing more than one apple, assemble a tablespoon of brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon for each apple. Using a fork, blend the cinnamon and sugar together, breaking up any lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the apple into eighths. Do this by cutting through the apple from one pole to the other and repeating with the halves and quarters. Take care to keep the pieces in order.?#&amp;?#&amp;Core apple slices by cutting a wedge out of the core remaining in each slice. Also trim off the stem and flower remains (calyx).?#&amp;?#&amp;Using one hand to hold sheet of aluminum foil large enough to wrap around the apple, position pieces in the cupped foil to form almost a whole apple (leaving two slices out).?#&amp;?#&amp;Scoop the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture into where the core of the apple used to be. Compress the mixture as need to fit. It&#39;s okay to leave a small mound since we&#39;ll be covering it up with the remaining two slices of apple.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the final two pieces and wrap tightly with the aluminum foil to hold everything in place. Bake for 15-20 minutes at 350&#176;F or on a hot grill for 10 minutes to cook the apple through. Unwrap and serve with the sugar sauce remaining in the core. This is a fun treat to produce at a casual get together or BBQ since your guests can help unwrap the apples from their aluminum casings (and if they don&#39;t know the apples are filled, it makes for a nice surprise!)</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">December 24, 2011 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Hot cocoa (the beverage made from ground cocoa and sugar commonly available in packets) can often be grainy, and I&#39;ve always assumed that to be due to imperfect dissolving of the cocoa solids into liquid, but there should be no reason why hot chocolate cannot be prepared so it isn&#39;t grainy. Most recipes I&#39;ve found bring the milk to a scalding hot temperature followed by blending chopped chocolate into the milk until dissolved. While reading these recipes, I kept wondering why the chocolate doesn&#39;t burn (or at least curdle) when melted into liquids at such high temperatures (simmering milk is about 160&#176;F (70&#176;C)- way above the temperature at which chocolate burns). Also, why do so many recipes call for simmering the milk for several minutes after the chocolate has been melted in? I went ahead and tested the most promising recipes and all resulted in tasty hot chocolate, but with a very fine sandy texture. After experimenting a bit, I came up with an easy technique to make the perfect cup of hot chocolate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Ten Great Gifts for Cooking For Engineers&#39; Fans?#&amp;?#&amp;Blue Bell Creamery Factory Tour?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicago 2011 Part 5 - Frontera Grill, XOCO?#&amp;?#&amp;Tempering Chocolate?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;The principle of the technique is the same as when mixing eggs into hot cream to make a custard. If you have a hot liquid, you can&#39;t just drop the eggs into the liquid without ending up with bits of cooked egg (resembling scrambled eggs floating in liquid). Beating the eggs first and then dropping them into the liquid will only serve to create the beautiful whispy (and delicate) &quot;flower&quot; formations found in soups such as hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. When you have to evenly blend eggs into a hot liquid, you have to temper it (not to be confused with tempering chocolate) - a slower, but simple to execute, process where you scoop the hot liquid little by little and incorporate it into the eggs. The small amount of hot liquid added each time doesn&#39;t contain enough heat to cook the eggs that it touches and, as it is incorporated, gradually raises the temperature of the egg. I hoped using a tempering technique would solve two potential problems when making hot chocolate: (1) burning the chocolate and (2) incomplete melting of the chocolate. By starting with already melted chocolate and incorporating hot liquid little by little, I hoped to produce a hot chocolate without any graininess and, luckily, that is exactly what happens.?#&amp;?#&amp;In this example, I&#39;m preparing a single cup (a little less than 10 oz/295 mL) of hot chocolate with 8 oz (235 mL) whole milk, 2 oz (57 g) bittersweet chocolate chips, 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and 1 tsp (2.5 g) powdered sugar.?#&amp;?#&amp;Main Ingredients?#&amp;chocolate - Select a chocolate you enjoy eating. The flavors will really come out in hot chocolate, so if you&#39;re not a fan of acidic chocolate or fruity chocolate or earthy chocolate, make sure you avoid chocolates where you detect those flavors you dislike when eating out of hand. You will be able to taste it in your hot chocolate. Also, just because you enjoy dark chocolate does not automatically mean that you&#39;ll prefer a hot chocolate made with high cacao content. I use a 63% bittersweet chocolate while Tina finds the bitter flavor to be overwhelming in hot chocolate (and normally she likes darker chocolate than I do). Be sure to use chocolate which is &quot;pure&quot;. The ingredients should contain cocoa (or cacao) solids, cocoa/cacao butter, sugar, vanilla, and lecithin. (Sometimes, the combination of cocoa solids and butter are referred to as cocoa or chocolate liquor.) The addition of waxes and other ingredients will probably not work as well in hot chocolate. If you&#39;re using bar chocolate, chop it up into small pieces (about the size of chocolate chips or smaller) so it will melt easily.?#&amp;milk, cream, or water - The liquid component of hot chocolate can be just as important as the chocolate itself.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">July 01, 2004 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The rib roast cut is usually so good that it doesn&#39;t need much seasoning. The ingredients I use are simple: a standing rib roast, salt, and pepper.?#&amp;also?#&amp;The items you&#39;ll need are a roasting pan (usually comes with your oven or you can get a large baking pan and a wire rack to place in it), a probe thermometer (like the Polder model that I use), some kitchen twine, and a pair of tongs.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Pan Fried Fish Fillets?#&amp;?#&amp;Kitchen Knives?#&amp;?#&amp;Osso Buco?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Porterhouse or T-Bone Steak?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicago 2011 Part 6 - Noodles by Takashi Yagihashi, Frontera Fresco, Marc Burger?#&amp;?#&amp;Hmmm, now you need a standing rib roast (also known as prime rib even if the beef isn&#39;t prime quality). The term &quot;standing&quot; means that because the bones are included in the roast, the roast can stand by itself. A rib roast with the bones removed is commonly referred to as a rolled rib roast. My preference is for the standing variety because the bones provide additional flavoring to the roast. A rib roast comprises of seven ribs starting from the shoulder (chuck) down the back to the loin. Each rib feeds about two people, so if you have a party of eight, buy and cook a four rib roast. The rib roast closest to the loin is more tender than the rib roast nearest the chuck. This end is referred to as the small end rib roast or loin rib roast or sirloin tip roast. The chuck end of the rib roast is bigger and tougher and is sometimes referred to as a half standing rib roast or large end rib roast.?#&amp;Depending on preference, you can dry age the roast for a few days to bring out additional flavor and produce a more buttery texture in the muscle (aging allows the natural enzymes to break down some of protein in the meat). Age the beef up to a week in the refrigerator by leaving it uncovered on a wire rack over a large pan to catch any drippings for at least a day and no more than seven days. When you are ready to cook the beef, trim off any dried pieces after the aging. It is common for a roast to lose about 10% to 15% of its weight during a week of aging.?#&amp;Take the rib roast out of the refrigerator and let it sit on the counter for a couple hours to raise the roast temperature to near room temperature. To help cook the roast evenly, we&#39;ll need to tie the roast. Using kitchen twine, tie the roast parallel to the rib bones at least at each end. I usually tie between each pair of ribs. Heat the roasting pan or a separate pan on the stove until hot with a little oil. Place the roast on the pan and sear for three minutes on each side. Remove from heat and season heavily with salt and pepper. Place on the grill of your roasting pan or on a wire rack. Now stick the probe of your thermometer into the roast so that the probe is approximately in the middle of the roast (and not touching a bone). Position the pan on an oven rack in the lowest position of your preheated 200&#176;F oven. Yes, 200&#176;F. The low heat will evenly cook the roast so that most of the roast will be at the desired temperature. Cooking at a higher temperature will finish the roast faster, but you will probably result in well-done on the outside of the roast that gradually results in a medium-rare interior (if you are trying to cook a medium-rare roast). Roasting at 200&#176;F will result in almost all the meat ending at medium-rare.?#&amp;Set your thermometer for 130&#176;F for a medium-rare roast (125&#176;F for rare; 145&#176;F for medium; any higher and it&#39;s overdone - you might as well be serving a cheaper piece of beef). When the roast is done (about 45 minutes per pound up to about 5 pounds - anything larger takes roughly 4 to 5 hours), remove from the oven, set the roast aside, and let it sit to redistribute juices for at least twenty minutes. This is a good time to make a jus from the drippings of the roast.?#&amp;Pour off any extra grease that&#39;s collected in the pan. You can save this to make Yorkshire pudding if you wish. Now deglaze the pan by pouring in 1/2&#160;cup beef broth and bring to a boil. After </Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Banana nut bread should always start with fully ripe bananas. Unfortunately, ripe bananas are not usually sold in the supermarket. While a banana ripens, the starch of the banana slowly converts to sugars. Allow green or yellow bananas to ripen at room temperature until the skin is liberally covered with brown spots. Once the banana has reached this stage, it is fully ripe. Bananas can be frozen once they have reached the desired ripeness. Their peels will turn completely brown, but don&#39;t worry about the banana within. When ready to use, simply thaw the bananas by letting them sit (unpeeled) on the counter until they warm up. Once thawed, peel the bananas.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Clam Chowder, New England Style?#&amp;?#&amp;Microwave Safe Containers?#&amp;?#&amp;Baked Cinnamon Apple?#&amp;?#&amp;Carrot Pulp Cake, Part I?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by preparing a loaf pan by buttering the bottom and sides. Lightly flour the pan and tap out the excess flour. The loaf pan should be around 5 in. by 9 in. (13 cm by 23 cm) in size - a little larger or smaller isn&#39;t a problem.?#&amp;?#&amp;The wet ingredients are: two ripe bananas, 6 Tbs. melted butter, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and two large eggs. For the dry ingredients: 1-1/3 cup flour, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, 1/4 tsp. baking powder, 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Combine and whisk all the dry ingredients except for the walnuts. The use of both baking soda and powder are necessary to provide enough leavening for the proper consistency of the bread. The baking soda is just enough to utilize the slight acidity of the bananas to create the desired carbon dioxide bubbles. Baking powder (which is a mix of baking soda, a base, and cream of tartar, an acid) provides even more leavening power.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mash the bananas, melted butter, and vanilla extract together. Lightly beat the eggs together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mash the banana mixture with the eggs until smooth and well blended.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the banana mixture onto the dry ingredients. Add the walnuts.?#&amp;?#&amp;Fold the ingredients together until no more white flour is uncovered while folding.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 55 minutes at 350&#176;F.?#&amp;?#&amp;After 55 minutes, the loaf of banana bread should be done. A wooden toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean. Set the pan on a wire rack to cool for ten minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the loaf from the pan and let cool on the wire rack. Serve warm or fully cooled. The loaf can be wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for about four or five days.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">According to Kellogg&#39;s, an employee by the name of Mildred Day concocted the snack as a treat for a Camp Fire Girls fundraiser. The recipe was first published in 1941 and has been such a success that Kellogg&#39;s has been selling a premade version of Rice Krispies Treats for the last ten years. Although many crisped and puffed cereal snacks have been popular prior to the Kellogg&#39;s recipe, the Rice Krispies Treats formula&#39;s genius is in its simplicity.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Marshmallows?#&amp;?#&amp;Baked Cinnamon Apple?#&amp;?#&amp;Lemon Bars?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Only three ingredients make the basic Rice Krispies Treats recipe: 6 cups of Kellogg&#39;s Rice Krispies cereal, 10 ounces of marshmallows, and 3 tablespoons butter. If Rice Krispies aren&#39;t available where you are, crisped rice (or for that matter any puffed cereal) can be substituted. Are you even allowed to call them Rice Krispies Treats if they don&#39;t contain Rice Krispies cereal? I wrote to Kellogg&#39;s and didn&#39;t get a clear answer. They did tell me the following:?#&amp;?#&amp;The Rice Krispies Treats? recipe is trademarked by Kellogg Company and is not available for use by the public. Therefore, we can not grantpermission to use this name. As with any recipe you make, it can be used as you want. However, you would have to use a generic name such as rice crisp cereal bars should you decide to sell them.?#&amp;?#&amp;Even though I don&#39;t plan to ever sell puffed rice treats, for the purposes of this article, I will refer to these snacks as crisped rice treats and only call the unmodified recipies Kellogg&#39;s Rice Krispies Treats.?#&amp;?#&amp;I often find that unmolding the crisped rice treat can be a pain, so I make myself a little sling out of parchment paper. Just butter a 9x13-in. baking pan and lay a sheet of parchment paper across the pan leaving the ends folded over the edge for use as handles.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt 3 Tbs. salted butter (if using unsalted, add a pinch of kosher salt) over medium-low heat in a large pot or saucepan (big enough to hold all the puffed rice and marshmallows you put aside earlier). Even though the marshmallows will melt down and take less volume, a large pot will be handy as you stir the ingredients.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the butter has melted, pour in all the marshmallows.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir until the marshmallows melt into a nearly smooth mass. (These steps can be accomplished with a microwave by heating both the marshmallows and the butter in the microwave on high for about two minutes and then stirring them to redistribute. Heat again for another minute on high and then stir until all is melted together. My trouble is getting a microwave safe bowl big enough to fit all the marshmallows and Rice Krispies cereal so when I stir, I don&#39;t make a mess.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the crisped rice into the pot and stir until the rice is evenly coated and no more large clumps of white marshmallow remain. This is when I add a half cup of something extra if I&#39;m so inclined - chocolate chips, M&amp;M&#39;s, raisins, currants, nuts, or anything that Tina asks for.?#&amp;?#&amp;Scoop the mixture into the 9x13-in. pan and spread into an even layer.?#&amp;?#&amp;When cooled, lift out of the baking pan and place on a cutting board.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Only two ingredients are needed for this recipe. That makes it real easy, but also means that the quality of ingredients is paramount. The proscuitto should be selected based on your personal tastes. My preference is for a salty (but not overwhelmingly so) proscuitto from the shoulder that is not so dry that it crumbles when chewed. I also like the proscuitto to have a bit of chew, but cut so thinly that it almost feels like it should dissolve in my mouth. How do you find the right proscuitto? If your deli counter sells different varieties, ask to taste them.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Anghelika&#39;s Tsatsiki (Tzatziki)?#&amp;?#&amp;CoolCover?#&amp;?#&amp;Ratatouille?#&amp;?#&amp;Prime Rib or Standing Rib Roast?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;For the melon, honeydew and muskmelon (sold as cantaloupes) are the most common in the U.S. You&#39;ll want an extremely ripe melon for this dish. Melons don&#39;t get sweeter off the vine (although their aroma may continue to develop), so make sure you select a good one at the market. The skin of the melon should be firm and free of bruising or soft spots. The skin of honeydews will also have changed from greenish to light yellow. The stem end should not be green on any melon, and the end of the melon opposite of the stem should have a nice strong aroma, but not one that smells odd or fermenting (this usually means the melon is overripe).?#&amp;?#&amp;You&#39;ll need about 12 ounces of thinly sliced proscuitto for half a medium sized melon. I generally only use half a melon for this recipe and use the other half for eating as is.?#&amp;?#&amp;Wash the melon with soap and water. The external surface of the melon can carry microbes that cause food poisoning, so it&#39;s best to wash it before cutting through it (especially since we&#39;re eating this raw). A muskmelon (American cantaloupe) has a bumpy netted surface that should be scrubbed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the melon from pole to pole. A safe way to do this is to cut a thin slice off the stem end and stand the melon up on the cut side. Slice the melon in half. Remove the collected juice, seeds and webbing. Cut the melon into bite sized pieces either by slicing into wedges and then into chunks or using a melon baller.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the proscuitto slices into strips that are large enough to wrap around the melon pieces or balls. I found that a 1-in. by 4-in. strip was the perfect size for my melon balls. Wrap the proscuitto slice around the melon piece and make sure that the ends of the proscuitto slice overlap a little. Thrust a toothpick through the overlap and out the other side to secure the proscuitto to the melon.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve immediately or chill thoroughly before serving. Chilled proscuitto e melone is preferred by many because there is not only opposing sweetness and saltiness but also a perceived temperature difference between the ice cold melon and the seemingly warmer proscuitto.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The texture of the ribs after cooking is not &quot;falling apart&quot;. The meat doesn&#39;t fall off the bone when you prod it with a fork. (For that, you&#39;ll want to take a look at Recipe File: Oven Baked Spare Ribs which will produce meat and cartilage that is just completely falling apart.) However, the ribs will be tender enough that it&#39;ll come off the bone easily when you&#39;re eating it, and the texture will provide just enough chew to be satisfying. I think that&#39;s the best texture for ribs (even though sometimes I do like the completely falling apart texture as well - that&#39;s why I have more than one recipe for making ribs!).?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven Baked Spare Ribs - Two Ways?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Pork Chops?#&amp;?#&amp;Slow Simmered Spicy Barbeque Sauce?#&amp;?#&amp;Everybody Eats Lunch by Cricket Azima?#&amp;?#&amp;Uchi (Austin, Texas)?#&amp;?#&amp;This recipe is more of a method than a firm step-by-step because there&#39;s a lot of flexibility when it comes to barbecuing ribs. I usually smoke at least two racks of ribs (a rack is one side of the hog - one continuous cut of meat that includes 8 to 15 ribs depending on your butcher and the style of cut) at a time but cooking one rack is pretty much the same exact recipe - cooking times don&#39;t change only the amount of spice rub you use up.?#&amp;Before we start, you&#39;ll need pork ribs. Baby back ribs come from the loin of the hog and the bones are generally smaller and the flesh is leaner and meatier than spare ribs which come from the side and belly. Because of the leanness of baby back ribs, the cooking time is less (about 1-1/2 hour compared to 2-1/2 hour) than that of spare ribs. In the photographs for this recipe, I prepared baby back ribs, but I&#39;ll mention the differences between preparation for baby back and spare ribs in the text.?#&amp;You&#39;ll also need a dry rub. I like using the rub from my Grilled Pork Chops recipe. In fact, I usually prepare a large quantity of the rub and put them into jars so I can use them whenever I need it. Alternatively, you can use a store bought spice rub like those found at Rod&#39;s Rub.?#&amp;For glazing, a barbecue sauce is needed. My Slow Simmered Spicy Barbecue Sauce is a crowd pleaser, but I like trying out other people&#39;s sauces and playing with a variety of store bought sauces as well.?#&amp;Wood chips (hickory or mesquite both work really well) are also needed. Part of what makes barbecue ribs authentic is the taste of smoke permeating the meat. Since the ribs cook in just a couple hours, the smokiness will be fairly mild.?#&amp;Let&#39;s begin.?#&amp;?#&amp;The night before you plan on barbecuing, prepare your pork ribs. Working with one rack at a time, lay the rack on a large cutting board. You&#39;ll want to trim off any excess meat because they won&#39;t cook at the same rate as the rib meat. Usually baby back ribs don&#39;t come with any extra flaps of meat, but spare ribs, St. Louis style and country style ribs often do. Cut them off and save them for a stir fry or other pork dish.?#&amp;?#&amp;Flip the rack over so the meaty side is face down. There is a thin membrane on this side that goes over all the bones. Removing this membrane is optional, but generally a good idea. It can become a very tough sheet that tastes and feels like you&#39;re chewing on plastic if you cook it with the ribs. To remove it, just thrust a blunt object (like the blunt tip of a thermometer) in between the membrane and the bones as shown in the photo. Wiggling your tool around a little should give you enough room to get a finger beneath the membrane.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once you&#39;ve got a grip on the membrane, pull it away from the back of the ribs. You&#39;ll need to use some force, but if you&#39;re smooth about it, the membrane should come away as one piece. Using a paper towel can help you grip the membrane better if your fingers keep slipping.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cover both sides of the rack with a generous portion of spice rub. I generally use about 1/2 cup of rub per rack of ribs. Make sure you use your hands to rub the mixture into the ribs. The moisture from the pork should be enough</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">A simple cranberry sauce can be made with roughly 2 parts cranberries, 1 part water and 1 part granulated sugar by weight. So, begin with a one pound bag of fresh cranberries, one cup water, and one cup granulated sugar. The sugar can be increased to 1-1/2 cup if a sweeter sauce is desired.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Scoville Units?#&amp;?#&amp;Leftover Cranberry Sauce Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Thanksgiving Dinner?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;Cream of Mushroom Soup?#&amp;?#&amp;Rinse the berries in a colander and remove and stems or bad berries. There&#39;s no need to spend too much time on this step. You can also use frozen cranberries - just rinse them and don&#39;t worry about defrosting them.?#&amp;In a medium saucepan, heat the water and sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Then bring the syrup up to a boil and pour in the cleaned berries. Adjust the heat so the mixture maintains a simmer and cook until all the berries pop or crack open, about five minutes to seven minutes. Take the sauce off the heat at this point, or simmer it down to the desired thickness. Remember the sauce will thicken a little while cooling. Chill overnight in the refrigerator before serving.?#&amp;While simmering the berries, additional ingredients can be added for more flavoring such as orange zest, flavored liquors, or spices like cinnamon.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Line a 9x13&#160;in. baking pan with parchment paper. The easiest way to do this is to rub some butter on the pan and place a sheet of parchment paper down. Then put some more butter on the parchment paper and place another sheet of parchment paper down perpendicular to the first sheet. This will line all the sides of the pan and not have lemon bars stuck to the side.?#&amp;?#&amp;In a food processor with steel blade, combine 1-3/4&#160;cups all purpose flour, 2/3&#160;confectioner&#39;s sugar, 1/4&#160;cup cornstarch, and 3/4&#160;tsp. salt. Pulse a few times to mix. Cut 3/4&#160;cup unsalted butter into 1&#160;inch pieces and add to processor bowl. Process until the flour forms a coarse meal texture (about 12 seconds). Pour the flour mixture into the pan and spread evenly. Using your hands, press down on the flour mixture and compact it evenly to produce a consistent thickness of about 1/4&#160;in. If you like, you can press the mixture up the sides of the pan about 1/2&#160;in., but I don&#39;t bother. Refrigerate the crust for thirty minutes to firm it up and then bake at 350&#176;F until golden brown (about 20 minutes).?#&amp;?#&amp;While the crust is baking, throw together the filling. We&#39;ll be using (from left to right) 2/3&#160;cup lemon juice, 1/3&#160;cup whole milk (do not substitute), 2&#160;teaspoons lemon zest, 4 large eggs, 1-1/3&#160;cups granulated sugar, 3&#160;tablespoons all purpose flour, and 1/8&#160;teaspoon salt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Whisk together the eggs, sugar, salt, and flour. (Baking Illustrated doesn&#39;t integrate the salt at this point - they mix it in with the wet ingredients, but I find it convenient to whisk the salt in with the dry ingredients.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir in lemon juice, lemon zest, and milk until well blended. Once the crust is done baking, stir the filling once again to make sure it is well blended. Pour filling onto the still hot crust.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake until filling is firm to the touch (about 20 minutes). Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature on a rack. After the lemon bars have cooled, lift the bars out by grasping the free ends of parchment paper and place on a cutting board. Use a pizza wheel or knife, cut into bars. I prefer to cut smaller bars (32 of them) because the filling is quite rich and strong.?#&amp;?#&amp;If desired, serve with confectioner&#39;s sugar liberally sifted over the bars.?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Creme Brulee (Cr&#232;me Br&#251;l&#233;e)?#&amp;?#&amp;Garlic Roasted Potatoes?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Kellogg&#39;s Rice Krispies Treats?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Seal uneaten bars in plastic wrap and consume within two days.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">October 26, 2004 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The tradition of pumpkin pie may date back to the first Thankgiving feast in 1621 (or some say the second Thanksgiving feast). In either case, most likely milk, honey, and spices were poured inside the pumpkin itself. The first pies probably came out more like pudding than like the custard fillings that we use today.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by assembling ingredients: 3/4 cup heavy cream, 3/4 cup whole milk, 1 can pumpkin (15 ounces), 1 cup dark brown sugar, 3 large eggs, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Fresh pumpkin can be used, but it must be cooked first (usually by cutting the pumpkin into pieces and baking in the oven). Its becoming increasingly difficult to find good pumpkins in supermarkets since the ones sold for carving dominate the shelves (or bins) and just aren&#39;t that good for eating. Save some time and trouble, buy the canned pumpkin. We&#39;ll cook the canned pumpkin briefly with the spices, so it&#39;ll be difficult to taste or smell any difference between the canned pumpkin and the fresh for this pie.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a 9-inch pie crust or defrost a frozen pie crust. Using a fork, punch holes into the dough so it won&#39;t rise while prebaking. If using pie weights, this step is unnecessary. Prebake the pie crust according to directions or at 400&#176;F for about 10 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Meanwhile, whisk pumpkin and spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt) together over medium heat in a medium sauce pan. When the pumpkin begins to cook, whisk in the brown sugar.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the mixture is fully blended, scrape the sides of the saucepan down and whisk again.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add milk and cream and continue to whisk.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the mixture begins to bubble and splutter, remove from heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the three eggs into a blender.?#&amp;?#&amp;Blend the eggs to form a nice creamy consistency (about two seconds).?#&amp;?#&amp;While blending on low speed, pour the pumpkin pie filling through the feeder hole in the blender cap. This will help break down any fibrous or tough parts of pumpkin creating a smooth filling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the pumpkin pie filling into the prebaked crust. If you used a deep dish pie crust, this should fit perfectly. I used a &quot;normal&quot; pie crust, so there was about a cup of filling left over, which can be made into pumpkin custards by filling ramekins. Bake at 400&#176;F for 25 minutes or until center of pie is jiggly when pie is rotated gently.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove from heat and let cool on a cooling rack for at least one hour. The center will fully set without over cooking the outer edges by removing the pie early. Refrigerate and serve cold, warmed up, or at room temperature.</Data></Cell>

Continue to freeze. Scrape every twenty minutes until no more liquid is in the granita.?#&amp;?#&amp;I like to serve the granita in a wine glass with some lemon zest and a sprig of mint on top.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Start by assembling the ingredients needed for the basic soup. You&#39;ll need about 1/3 cup (70 g) flour, 4 ounces (110 g) butter, 1 cup (235 mL) chicken broth or stock, 4 ounces (110 g) diced onions (about 1/2 large yellow onion), 2 oz. (55 g) celery, 2 oz. (55 g) leeks, 7 cups (1.65 L) whole milk (not pictured). You&#39;ll also need to have 12 to 16 ounces (340 to 450 g) button mushrooms, 1/4 teaspoon (0.4 g) dried, ground tarragon, 1/2 cup (120 mL) heavy cream, lemon juice, salt, and pepper for finishing the recipe.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by washing the leeks. Often, mud and dirt will get trapped in the layers of the leek, so special care should be taken to wash them thoroughly. The easiest way to do this is simply to break the leeks apart under running water and use your fingers to help wash the dirt away. The celery should also be rinsed and deveined.?#&amp;?#&amp;Chop off the green tops, leaving the base of the leeks to make a total of about 2 ounces. Dice the leeks, celery, and onion. This combination of vegetables is often called a white mirepoix (while a &quot;normal&quot; mirepoix substituting carrots for the leeks).?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt the butter in a 3-1/2 quart or larger pot over low heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the onions, celery, and leeks to the melted butter and turn the heat up to medium-low. Stir the white mirepoix as it sweats until the onions are translucent, about 6 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the flour to the mixture and continue to stir and cook over medium-low heat. Cook for about twelve minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;The flour mixture should have taken on a slightly yellowed appearance at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;While stirring, slowly pour the chicken broth into the pot. After all the broth has been incorporated into the flour mixture, keep stirring until there are no more lumps.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, slowly add milk to the pot. To keep from forming lumps, you&#39;ll want to pour a little milk at a time. Slowly pour about 1/2 cup milk into the pot and stir until it&#39;s been fully integrated into the flour. Repeat with 1/2 cup milk at a time until four cups of milk have been stirred in. At that point, it should be fine to pour in the last three cups of milk without lumps forming.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring the soup to a full boil, then simmer for 45 minutes (until smooth and thickened).?#&amp;?#&amp;In the meantime, prepare the ingredients for the final part of the recipe: 12 to 16 ounces (340 to 450 g) button mushrooms, 1/4 teaspoon (0.4 g) dried, ground tarragon, and 1/2 cup (120 mL) heavy cream. Lemon juice, salt, and pepper will be used for seasoning as well.?#&amp;?#&amp;Wash the mushrooms.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut all the mushrooms into a fine dice. It&#39;s important to get the mushrooms cubes to be as uniform as possible so they will cook evenly. It also makes the final soup more attractive.?#&amp;?#&amp;Set the mushrooms aside as the soup simmers.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Tempering Chocolate?#&amp;?#&amp;TrailBlaze Bake-At-Home Energy Bars?#&amp;?#&amp;Creamy Garlic Mashed Potatoes?#&amp;?#&amp;Turkey or Chicken Stock?#&amp;?#&amp;Traditional Chicken Pot Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the soup has simmered for 45 minutes, it can be chilled and refrigerated to finish the soup at a later time (up to three days). When it is time to finish the recipe, just reheat the soup until simmering temperature and continue the recipe from here.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the 1/4 teaspoon tarragon to the soup and stir in.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add all the diced mushrooms to the soup and stir until evenly mixed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Simmer for 10 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Turn off the heat and stir in 1/2 cup heavy cream. Add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. For my ingredients, I found that 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon table salt, and 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground pepper was just right.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The ingredients are simple, but the proportions are critical. For 2 quarts of water, we&#39;ll need 3/4 cup (150 g) sugar, 2 ounces (60 mL) lemon juice, and two bags of black tea.

Cover with a lid and allow steeping for at least 1 hour. Although, in general, black teas should not be steeped for this long because of the excessive release of bitter tannins, this did not seem to be an issue when brewing this much tea with only two bags. Using more bags with a shorter steep time generated a different flavor profile that did not blend as nicely with the lemon juice.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the tea has been sufficiently steeped, remove the tea bags and add the sugar and lemon juice. Stir until the sugar completely dissolves.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour tea into a pitcher and add ice cubes until the volume has returned to two quarts.?#&amp;?#&amp;Refrigerate until completely chilled (at least four hours) before serving.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There are a variety of recipes for Ratatouille and the ingredients often change from cook to cook, but most contain eggplant (aubergine), garlic, onions, zucchini (Italian squash or marrows), and bell peppers. Usually the recipe is seasoned with Herbes de Provence, but (as in this recipe) it can be as simple as parsley and basil. Often the individual vegetable components are cooked separately in olive oil, but I like this recipe that cooks the vegetables together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Shepherd&#39;s Pie (Cottage Pie)?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat Transfer and Cooking?#&amp;?#&amp;Joy of Cooking (75th Anniversary Edition; 2006)?#&amp;?#&amp;Marshmallows?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;I adapted this recipe from the Culinary Institute of America&#39;s newest book - Vegetables: Recipes and Techniques from the World&#39;s Premier Culinary College (which I will review soon).?#&amp;?#&amp;To begin, assemble the ingredients: 6 garlic cloves, 5 medium button or brown mushrooms (I prefer brown for more flavor), 1 medium zucchini, 5 sprigs of Italian parsley, 4 sprigs of basil, 1 medium onion, 1 can diced tomatoes (or 2 tomatoes peeled, seeded, and diced), chicken or vegetable stock (we&#39;ll need 3/4 cup or 180mL), 1 Tbs. tomato paste, 1 medium green bell pepper, and 1 large eggplant (about 1 pound or 450 g). Drain the canned tomatoes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Wash and scrub all the vegetables. Remove the parsley and basil leaves from their stems. Dice the green bell pepper, eggplant, and onion. Quarter the zucchini lengthwise then slice into 1/4-in. (1/2 cm) segments. Quarter the mushrooms. Chop the parsley and the basil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start cooking by heating olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saute until the garlic smell intensifies, about one minute.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the diced onion and continue to saute until they turn translucent, about 4 more minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the onions are translucent, add 1 Tbs. tomato paste. The tomato paste will be in a clump and will take a bit of stirring and pressing to get it to spread out and cover the onions and garlic.?#&amp;?#&amp;As you work at spreading the paste out and mixing it with the onions and garlic, the paste will cook and darken in color. Once some of the paste starts to stick to the pan and brown, it&#39;s time to add the stock (about one minute).?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour in 3/4 cup chicken or vegetable stock and stir until the broth begins to simmer. Using your spatula or utensil, scrub the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits of garlic, onion, or tomato paste.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the diced eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Stir to combine thoroughly and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring every couple minutes to promote even heating.?#&amp;?#&amp;The eggplant will release a lot of liquid (slowly) into the pot and it&#39;s in this liquid that you&#39;ll want to simmer the other ingredients in. To evenly cook all the ingredients, you&#39;ll have to stir it to make sure the vegetables spend time touching eggplant liquid. As a bonus, the flavors mix amazingly well during this process.?#&amp;?#&amp;The eggplant will mostly be falling apart at this point, but the zucchini, bell peppers, and mushrooms should be tender but not yet mushy.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the diced tomatoes and stir in. After about a minute, the tomatoes will have heated through. Turn the heat down to the lowest setting.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir in the chopped parsley and basil. Add salt and pepper to taste.?#&amp;Although ratatouille is usually served hot, we love eating this dish cold (usually at room temperature) with freshly toasted slices of a baguette especially during the summer.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">I used (from the top, clockwise) 1-1/2&#160;cups all purpose flour, 3&#160;tablespoons sugar, 1-1/2&#160;teaspoons baking powder, 1/2&#160;teaspoon salt, 1-1/2&#160;cup milk, 3&#160;tablespoons unsalted butter (melted), 2&#160;large eggs, and 1/2&#160;teaspoon vanilla extract.?#&amp;?#&amp;I combined the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt) into a large bowl and whisked a little.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, I whisked the wet ingredients (milk, butter, eggs, and vanilla) together.?#&amp;?#&amp;I then poured the wet ingredients onto the dry and whisk, but not too long. Just enough to combine thoroughly. If there are some lumps left, it&#39;s okay. When the batter cooks it&#39;ll smooth out and you won&#39;t taste it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Joy of Cooking now says to fold in any additions now. I added some frozen blueberries that I thawed quickly in a some warm water and drained. This is where the recipe makes a fatal mistake. More on that later.?#&amp;?#&amp;I then quickly prepare my two burner griddle. You can use an electric griddle as well. In both cases, the surface should be smooth and non-stick.?#&amp;?#&amp;Turning both burners on, I heated the griddle until a few drops of water tossed onto the surface ran around franticly. (If the water jumps off the griddle, then turn down the heat. If the water just sits there, increase the heat.) Now, I melted a pad of butter onto the griddle to lubricate it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using a paper towel, I rubbed the butter around until it evenly coated the pan and I couldn&#39;t see any butter. You don&#39;t want too much fat on the griddle or you&#39;ll be frying the pancakes.?#&amp;?#&amp;I scooped 1/3 cups of batter onto the griddle to make a pancake. This is when I discovered that the blueberries impeded the flow of the batter. Usually, when I make my buttermilk pancakes, I pour the batter out steadily onto one spot and it forms a near perfect circle. I then sprinkle my filling on top of the batter on the griddle. Now I know why. First, the batter doesn&#39;t flow evenly and forms alien shapes on the griddle because of the blueberries. Second, the blueberries are unevenly distributed and some pancakes have some and some have a lot. Don&#39;t make this mistake - put the fillings in after the batter hits the griddle, not in the batter. You might notice in this picture there&#39;s a big lump in the batter of the second pancake. Don&#39;t worry about that, it evens out and can&#39;t be tasted. The pancake will be tough if we over mix.?#&amp;?#&amp;I cooked the first side until bubbles covered the pancake surface and begin to pop. I then flipped the pancake over.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the second side has lightly browned (about half the time it took to cook the first side), I removed and served. If you need to make a lot of pancakes, you can stack them on a plate in a 200&#176;F oven. On Good Eats, Alton Brown recommends placing paper towels between each layer of pancake, but I find that it works for me to stack without the paper towel waste. Usually, Tina and I can&#39;t eat too many pancakes at a time, but I still make a full batch.?#&amp;?#&amp;Extra pancakes can then be frozen. A quick trip to the toaster or toaster oven will produce homemade pancakes much better than the supermarket frozen kind. This picture is of a buttermilk pancake that came out very circular because the filling was added after the batter was poured on the griddle.?#&amp;?#&amp;The results of the tasting proved that these pancakes were quite good - on par with the buttermilk pancakes. A little fruit topping or maple syrup and they resulted in a delicious breakfast. So, I&#39;ve decided to promote this recipe from a Test Recipe to one for the Recipe File.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">July 08, 2005 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Start with two pounds (0.9 kg) russet potatoes (about two large ones), 20 cloves of garlic (with the skins on), 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 4 oz. unsalted butter. Russet potatoes are used because they are higher in starch than other potato varieties. If we used red potatoes or other waxy varieties, the mashed potatoes would not be as smooth and creamy.?#&amp;?#&amp;Toss the garlic into a pan and heat with a lid on over low heat. Any size pan will do as long as it has a lid.?#&amp;?#&amp;Keep the garlic over low heat and toss occasionally until the garlic cloves become darker in color and develop dark spots, about twenty minutes. Remove the garlic from the heat and leave covered for another twenty minutes. Once the garlic has cooled from the toasting (and mild steam), remove them and peel them. Cut off the woody ends of the garlic as well.?#&amp;?#&amp;Meanwhile, bring enough water to cover the potatoes (about 3 quarts should be enough) to a boil. Wash, peel, and chop the potatoes into rough 1 inch cubes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil the potatoes over medium heat for ten minutes (or until potatoes are soft throughout). While the potatoes are cooking, warm up the heavy cream either in a small pot or in the microwave oven. Don&#39;t boil the cream, just warm it up so it&#39;s not cold when we add it to the potatoes later.?#&amp;?#&amp;Drain the water from the potatoes. If the potatoes are wet or soggy, return the potatoes to the pot and cook over low heat while stirring cook off any extra water.?#&amp;?#&amp;The potatoes can be mashed through a variety of methods (such as a potato ricer or a wire masher), but one of the creamiest methods is using an electric mixer. Pour the potatoes into the mixing bowl of your mixer and add the toasted garlic. I like running the garlic through a garlic press or chopping and mashing them first with a knife. Add the butter in chunks to the potatoes (the heat of the potatoes will melt the butter), and mix on low speed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the heavy cream to the mixture and mix. Add salt and white pepper to taste. Once the mashed potatoes are creamy and smooth, stop mixing and remove to a serving bowl. Be careful not to over mix because the potatoes can become gummy when overworked. (If desired, the mashed potatoes can be dressed up with a dash of paprika and a sprinkling of fresh parsley.)</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">August 12, 2005 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To prepare the marinade, you&#39;ll need two limes, 1/4 cup table salt, 2 cloves of garlic, and a chile of your choice.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the limes in half (to prepare for juicing) and mince the garlic and chile pepper. Pour the salt into a large measuring cup and add enough water to make four cups (about 1 liter). Stir the salt water until the salt has dissolved. This is also a good time to prepare the chicken. The marinade will be enough for two whole chickens (cut up) or 8 pounds of drumsticks (my favorite). Put all the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. I called this mixture a marinade instead of a brine because not only does the solution include salt, but also acid (lime juice). A soaking solution with acid should be referred to as a marinade.?#&amp;?#&amp;Juice three of the lime halves (using a juice extractor or a reamer) and add the juice to the salt water. Add the minced garlic and chile. Stir once to mix. Pour this into the plastic bag and reseal the bag. Try to make sure all the chicken is submerged in the marinade. With a fairly full bag, you may need to squeeze out almost all the air to accomplish this. Place the bag in a container and place in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Two hours is best, but any longer, and the chicken may become too salty. (The minimum ingredients in this marinade are the water, salt, and lime juice. The garlic and chile can be omitted if you don&#39;t have them handy.)?#&amp;?#&amp;After the two hours, preheat your grill and remove the chicken from the refrigerator and take each piece out of the plastic bag and rinse it off in the sink. If you don&#39;t rinse the chicken off, then the salt water lingering on the surface will make the chicken too salty.?#&amp;?#&amp;For seasoning the surface of the chicken, combine 1 tablespoon paprika, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. ground coriander seed, and 1 tsp. garlic powder. Feel free to try different spice and herb combinations to fit your taste.?#&amp;?#&amp;Toss the chicken with 1 Tbs. olive oil, the juice from the remaining half lime, and the seasonings prepared in the previous step. Using your hands to mix the chicken with the seasonings is the fastest way I know of to get an even distribution.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the chicken pieces on the grill, being careful not to crowd the pieces. Grill, turning every five minutes, until white meat reaches 165&#176;F - 170&#176;F and dark meat reaches 175&#176;F.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the chicken from the grill and let stand for five minutes before serving.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">April 12, 2005 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Lately, I&#39;ve received a lot of mail requesting recipes that take little or no preparation time - for the busy student, hard working professional, or web junkies eager to get back to surfing online. Since I&#39;ve been working fairly long hours lately, I haven&#39;t been able to spend much time in the kitchen. When I do cook, it&#39;s basic but flavorful fare. This asparagus recipe is one that requires less than five minutes of preparation time and works well with most entrees (which can be prepared while the asparagus is in the oven).?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Condensed Milk Fudge?#&amp;?#&amp;Asparagus with Almonds?#&amp;?#&amp;Baked Cinnamon Apple?#&amp;?#&amp;Prime Rib or Standing Rib Roast?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;First, place a rack into the center of your oven and preheat it to 350&#176;F. While the oven is warming up, wash the asparagus to remove any dirt particles that may be lodged in the tips or stuck to the stalks. Snap off the bottoms of the asparagus stalks. The bottom of the stalk is fibrous and not very pleasant to eat, so just grab the bottom and bend until it snaps. Let the stalk snap at a natural breaking point as close to the cut end as possible. This position will be different for each stalk, but will very nearly guarantee that all your asparagus stalks will be tender. (Cutting off the bottoms doesn&#39;t work too well since you have to guess where the stalk stops being tender.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour about 1 Tbs. extra virgin olive oil per pound of asparagus onto a sheet pan lined with aluminum foil (for easy clean up - saving time after cooking and dining is important too).?#&amp;?#&amp;Using your hands, roll the asparagus through the oil and rub them against each other until the oil coats them all. Spread the asparagus out in the sheet pan to form a single layer. Apply freshly ground black pepper and salt to the oiled asparagus.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the asparagus laden sheet pan into the oven and allow it to roast for 10 to 15 minutes.?#&amp;Roasting the asparagus until it just changes color from a medium green to a dark green will result in tender but still somewhat crisp texture. Continuing to roast until some light browning appears will provide a mushy and somewhat limp texture with a heightened flavor. Continuing to roast will dehydrate the asparagus and result in a fibrous mass in the shape of blackened asparagus.?#&amp;This recipe can be doubled or quadrupled without adding additional roasting time. If you need to use more than one sheet pan, then set two racks near the 1/3 and 2/3 positions in the oven. After about 6 or 7 minutes or roasting, rotate the pans and finish.</Data></Cell>

Dribble in oil while blending until all of the oil is in the mixture. (I should mention that although several recipes call for using a food processor, I would prefer to do make the sauce in a bar blender. Often, it is harder to clean the food processor than a blender when dealing with extremely liquid foods.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven Baked Spare Ribs - Two Ways?#&amp;?#&amp;Homemade Mayonnaise?#&amp;?#&amp;Beef Stroganoff?#&amp;?#&amp;Thanksgiving Dinner?#&amp;?#&amp;Basic Biscuits?#&amp;?#&amp;Whisk:?#&amp;Start with the vinegar and any herbs &amp; spices you want in a mixing bowl.

Screw lid back on jar and shake vigorously. Continue pouring in oil and shaking until half the oil has been integrated. Continue by pouring two or three tablespoons at a time.?#&amp;After the dressing is made, you can safely store it in the refrigerator for about two weeks.?#&amp;You&#39;ll notice that my recipe calls for 3 cloves of pressed garlic. Now, I don&#39;t believe in garlic presses because I don&#39;t want to pay $12 - $15 for a garlic press that is only useful when I need pulverized garlic. Instead, I use a Microplane Zester which also zests and grates when it&#39;s not pulverizing garlic (or ginger).?#&amp;By the way, never use a garlic press for mincing garlic, because it doesn&#39;t.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">(I did this batch while watching TV)?#&amp;The ingredients needed are (clockwise from top) 2 cups heavy cream, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 8 large egg yolks, and 1/2 cup sugar.?#&amp;?#&amp;First pour the sugar into the egg yolks.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Porterhouse or T-Bone Steak?#&amp;?#&amp;Lemon Bars?#&amp;?#&amp;The Classic Tiramisu (original recipe?)?#&amp;?#&amp;Condensed Milk Fudge?#&amp;?#&amp;Beat the yolks until smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat the heavy cream until almost simmering (you can bring to a simmer and let it cool a minute). Add heavy cream to the egg yolks one tablespoon at a time while stirring vigorously. This will temper the eggs so as to not curdle them (or make scrambled eggs) when exposed to the heat of the heavy cream.?#&amp;?#&amp;When about 1/4 cup of heavy cream has been integrated into the yolks, pour the yolks into the heavy cream and mix until smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, using a fine mesh sieve, strain the custard mixture to remove any small clumps that may remain in the mixture. This step will help ensure a silky texture to the custard. Blend in the vanilla extract after the mixture has been strained.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the mixture into six to eight ramekins depending on size. (Makes a little more than eight four-ounce creme brulees.) In the picture below, I filled six four-ounce ramekins and two six ounce ramekins (the six-ouncers were not full).?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the ramekins in a baking pan. Pour boiling water into the pan (be careful not to get water into the ramekins), so that the water level is halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cooking the custards in a water bath will provide a low even temperature for the custards to cook evenly and set properly. Place in an oven preheated to 250&#176;F for about one hour.?#&amp;?#&amp;After an hour, check to see if the custards are done. We want them to be set on the outside edge, but jiggly (like jello) at the center. The easiest way to do this is to take a pair of tongs with food grade rubber bands wrapped around the ends to help grip the ramekins. Pick up a ramekin and shake to see if the centers jiggle. If only the center jiggles a little, it&#39;s done. If the whole thing is set, remove immediately - it&#39;ll be a little over done, but still delicious. If it&#39;s not done, just put it back in the water bath and check again in ten minutes. Once the custards are done, let them cool on a cooling rack to room temperature. This will let the custards finish cooking the centers on their own.?#&amp;?#&amp;Wrap the custards in their ramekins in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least eight hours before serving.?#&amp;About an hour before serving, remove the plastic wrap from each ramekin and use a paper towel to gently soak up any moisture that may have extruded from the custard tops. Pour about a teaspoon of turbinado (&quot;sugar in the raw&quot;) sugar in the middle of each custard. Tilt the ramekin and gently shake to let gravity move the sugar around until the top surface of the custard is covered evenly with turbinado sugar. Using a kitchen butane torch, propane blow torch, or welding torch (whatever strong open flame you&#39;ve got lying around), heat the sugar until it bubbles and changes color. With a small butane torch, I take my time and don&#39;t move from one side of the creme brulee to the other until the spot I&#39;ve been working on has achieved the brown color that I want. This takes a little over a minute for each creme brulee. (The process is faster with a larger torch.) Don&#39;t worry about heating up the custard underneath, we&#39;ll refrigerate the creme brulee for a bit before serving. Do worry about lighting your kitchen counter on fire. I usually place the ramekin on a piece of aluminum foil placed over a cooling rack.?#&amp;Once you&#39;re done scorching your cream, place the ramekins back in the refrigerator for about 45 minutes. The caramel will still be hard, but if you wait too much longer, the sugar will start to soften and dissolve into the custard.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">October 28, 2004 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Maybe it&#39;s because lemonade is so readily available that causes the less popular limeade to taste better to me. In any case, I am a sucker for &quot;exotic&quot; or &quot;different&quot; beverages. If there&#39;s a new soda flavor, I&#39;ve got to try it. When limes are on sale, I can&#39;t help but make limeade.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Pumpkin Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Halloween Green Slime Spinach Dip?#&amp;?#&amp;Lemon Iced Tea?#&amp;?#&amp;Lime Marinated Grilled Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Gravlax?#&amp;?#&amp;I use sour Persian limes (the type the supermarkets label simply &quot;Limes&quot;). All limes turn yellow as they ripen (or overripen), so don&#39;t be thrown off if the limes have some yellow spots. For juicing, buy limes that are not completely hard. The softer limes generally have thinner rinds and more juice. I find that, in general, six limes produce about one cup of lime juice.?#&amp;Before juicing the limes, roll them on the counter while pressing down with your palm to help break down the interior membranes and make juicing easier. Then cut them in half along the equator and press and twist against a reamer to release the juice. I don&#39;t like pulp in my fruit drinks, so I juice through a fine mesh strainer. Then I pour the liquid through another strainer (because I really don&#39;t like pulp in my juice). You should plan to have the juice end up in a measuring cup when you are done juicing and straining.?#&amp;You can pour sugar directly into the lime juice and water when you prepare limeade, but sometimes you get gritty pieces of undissolved granules of sugar. To solve this problem, just prepare a simple syrup by heating one cup water and dissolving one cup granulated sugar into it. The simple syrup can be made in larger quantities and kept in the fridge for future use in making lemonade, sweetened iced tea, caramel sauces, etc.?#&amp;Now how much simple syrup should we add to the lime juice? I worked it out to be 3 times as much. This quantity of simple syrup will be enough to temper the tart acidity of the lime juice without being overly sweet. So, for each cup of lime juice, heat 1-1/2 cup water and 1-1/2 cup granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved and remove from heat. Pour the three cups of simple syrup into the lime juice and stir. Now you have four cups of limeade concentrate. You can refrigerate this or even freeze them into ice cube trays for instant limeade whenever you want.?#&amp;To convert the limeade concentrate into limeade, simply add two cups of water for each cup of concentrate. If you desire a little less tartness and sweetness, just add an addition half cup of water to the mixture.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The lamb chops used in this recipe can be either shoulder chops or loin chops. The pictures show two shoulder chops being prepared.?#&amp;?#&amp;The ingredients for the marinade are the same as for the sauce so gather together: 1 cup orange juice mixed with 1 cup pineapple juice, 4 stems of fresh rosemary, 2 cloves chopped garlic, 1 medium onion (finely chopped), 1/2 teaspoon table salt, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, and 1 teaspoon dried thyme.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix everything except the rosemary together. Reserve about 3/4 cup of the resulting mixture for creating the sauce later.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the unreserved mixture into a large resealable plastic bag and position two to four lamb chops into the marinade. Sandwich the fresh rosemary between the chops and reseal the bag (working as much air out as possible). Place the bag on a plate into the refrigerator to marinade for at least one hour and no more than four. The pineapple juice contains enzymes that will tenderize the lamb by breaking down the protein structures. Marinating too long may result in an undesirable mushy texture.?#&amp;?#&amp;After marinating, remove the lamb from the bag and pat dry with a kitchen towel or paper towels. You can leave any herbs or onions left sticking to the surface of the chop for caramelization and inclusion in the sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat a large pan with one to two tablespoons of high quality extra virgin olive oil (the type that doesn&#39;t smoke at low temperatures). The amount of oil will be dictated by the dimensions of your pan. You want just enough oil to evenly coat the pan when the oil is hot. Once the oil is up to temperature (the oil flows freely, the surface of the oil shimmers, and the edges begin to emit slight wisps of smoke), place the lamb chops into the pan without crowding. Leave the chops alone for four minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Because we didn&#39;t remove the onions on the surface of the lamb chops, the onions become caramelized and provide a distinct oniony sweet fragrance to this dish. Unfortunately, they also prevent the lamb from developing a beautiful sear. I usually, scrape off the excess onions from the second side before flipping the chop over so a sear is formed on that side. The onions that have been scraped off will caramelize while the chop is searing. So, scrape off the top side of the chops and flip them over when the first four minutes have elapsed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Beer Can Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Buttercream Frosting (American)?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Pork Chops?#&amp;?#&amp;Prime Rib or Standing Rib Roast?#&amp;?#&amp;Tempering Chocolate?#&amp;?#&amp;After another four minutes, measure the internal temperature of each chop. Remove them if they have hit 140&#176;F (60&#176;C). If your chops are thicker, then simply pour the reserved marinade mixture into the pan and allow the chops to simmer over medium to medium-low heat until they reach 140&#176;F. (Check the temperature every minute to two minutes.) After the chops have been removed, bring the heat up to medium-high and deglazed the pan with the reserved marinade. Just use a wooden spoon to scrape up any little bits on the pan. They should come off in the boiling liquid.?#&amp;?#&amp;Reduce the sauce until it it thickened. A good way to identify how thick a sauce has become is to run a spoon or spatula through the sauce and see how long the resulting trail is filled back in with the sauce. The sauce is ready when a trail remains for several seconds.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve with sauce spooned on top of the lamb chop.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Begin by assembling the ingredients: 1-1/2 lb. beef tenderloin (if using another cut, select a lean cut and remove any excess fat, gristle, or membranes), 1/2 medium onion, 1/2 lb. button mushrooms, 3/4 cup to 1 cup beef broth (preferably low sodium - salt can always be added but is difficult to take out), 2 tablespoons of cognac, 1 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, and 1 teaspoon of dried dill weed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Thickly slice the mushrooms and finely dice the onions. Cut the beef into thinly against the grain, and then slice into 1 inch (2.5 cm) by 2 inch (5.1 cm) rectangles. (Freezing the beef for about an hour and using a sharp knife will make the slicing easier.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Place a large pot filled with 4 quarts of water over high heat (for the egg noodles). While the water is coming to a boil, place two tablespoons of butter in a large saute pan or skillet (preferably a traditional pan or cast iron, not non-stick) over medium heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the butter stops foaming, place the strips of beef onto the hot pan. Try not crowd the pan - most likely you&#39;ll need to brown the beef in at least two batches. Once the beef has been laid down on the pan, allow it to brown, about one minute. Once the beef has browned, flip the pieces over and let the other side brown. Remove the beef and repeat as needed to brown all the beef. (It is okay to add a bit of vegetable oil if the pan starts to dry up.) If done properly, the beef should still have a medium rare interior after this browning process. By browning the meat first, we give the beef tenderloin a stronger flavor and also leave some flavorful, browned, caramelized bits (fond) in the pan for making the sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all the beef have been browned, place the diced onions in the pan over low heat. Move the onions around a bit to coat evenly in the remaining fat in the pan, then spread out the onions and allow them to cook. The onions will release liquid as they cook down, about four minutes. While the onions are cooking, use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape the fond off the bottom of the pan and mix into the onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the thickly sliced mushrooms to the onions and stir to evenly coat with fat. Add a pinch os salt to the mushrooms. Seasoning with salt at this stage will help the mushrooms release their water faster. Allow the mushrooms to cook, tossing occassionally, until all the liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Artichokes?#&amp;?#&amp;Common Materials of Cookware?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicken &amp; Mushroom Marsala?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven Baked Chicken and Rice?#&amp;?#&amp;Traditional Chicken Pot Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the beef broth and cognac to the pan and turn up the heat to medium or medium-high and allow it to reduce. When reduced, the liquid should coat the back of a spoon (or your mushrooms). This will take about 15 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;While waiting for the mushrooms to cook, cook the egg noodles (a 12 ounce bag is a good amount). Hopefully, the water should be boiling at this point. Add the egg noodles and cook to the desired texture. Remove the noodles from the pot and toss with 2 tablespoons butter to keep them from sticking and to add some flavor. Rinsing the noodles will make it more difficult for sauces to cling to the noodles.?#&amp;?#&amp;Back to the stroganoff: Lower the heat and add the sour cream and Dijon mustard.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir the mixture together and bring to a light simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the beef (and any juices that have collected in the plate) to the mixture and stir in. Allow the sauce to simmer, reheating the beef. Do not heat the beef too long, or you could overcook it - about two minutes should do it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir in some dill and season with salt and black pepper to taste.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve immediately over the egg noodles. The sauce is thick, rich, and flavorful, so there&#39;s no reason to drench the noodles with the sauce. Simply place a pile of egg noddles on a plate and scoop some beef stroganoff over it.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">- Michael Chu?#&amp;The Science of Gels?#&amp;A colloid is a way of organizing matter and, by extension, a hydrocolloid is a way of organizing water. (For the geeks: hydrocolloid is a culinary term for long-chain molecules that are attracted to water, technically known as &quot;hydrophilic polymers.&quot; Gesundheit!) Think Jell-O-liquid particles trapped in a solid matrix. Hydrocolloids also occur in nature. Lettuce is nothing more than a crunchy water bottle, comprised of more than 98% water! Man-made hydrocolloids include jams and jellies (gels), vinaigrette (an emulsion), and whipped cream (a foam).?#&amp;Gels are simply water made solid. They&#39;re the type of hydrocolloid we&#39;ll look at first. Imagine a mesh of intertwined molecules that keep water from sloshing around. Though many ingredients help create gels, there are broadly two classes: carbohydrates that gel and proteins that gel. Cornstarch is the best-known carb gelling agent. Agar-agar is another. Gelatin is the best-known protein gelling agent. Casein, the protein in milk that makes cheese possible, is another. Then there&#39;s myosin, a protein that helps muscles contract.And when that muscle (meat) is cooked, myosin denatures and gels. . . . Yes, cooked or cured meats are also gels!?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Sauteed Spinach?#&amp;?#&amp;Georges (San Francisco, California)?#&amp;?#&amp;Dirty Rice?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Crunchy Bloody Mary?#&amp;Shorthand?#&amp;Boil 120 mL tomato juice, 1 t Worcestershire, &#189; t celery salt, 1 t agar-agar, 1 t hot sauce.

Fold a long sheet of aluminum foil into pleats (ridged like a tin roof) and put it on a baking sheet. Nestle the celery ribs between the pleats, open side up. This will help keep them from tipping and spilling the tomato juice mixture. You can also try simply leaning the celery ribs against one another.?#&amp;Pickup?#&amp;00. In a nonstick skillet, combine the 120 ml (&#189; c) tomato juice, 1 t Worcestershire sauce, &#189; t celery salt, 2 g (1 scant t) agar-agar, and &#189;-1 t hot sauce, if using. Bring to a boil, then stir in the 60ml (&#188; c) vodka.?#&amp;01. Using a spouted cup, carefully pour the Bloody Mary mixture into the celery stalks. It&#39;s OK if it drips onto or over the sides - you can wipe the excess off?#&amp;later. The mixture will start to thicken and firm up as you fill the celery. Go back and top off the celery ribs as needed so they&#39;re as full as possible.?#&amp;02. Put in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. The Bloody Mary mixture will firm up almost immediately, but it&#39;s best consumed very cold.?#&amp;03. Cut into bite-size (2.5-cm/1&quot;) pieces. If you like, top each piece with a tiny bit of horseradish. Delish.?#&amp;</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The best recipe for Macaroni and Cheese that I&#39;ve made so far is the one recently published in Cook&#39;s Country Magazine (in the April/May 2007 issue). The texture is simply amazing - smooth but not runny, cheesy but without clumping or separating.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Shepherd&#39;s Pie (Cottage Pie)?#&amp;?#&amp;Cooking With Aluminum?#&amp;?#&amp;Campbell&#39;s Green Bean Casserole?#&amp;?#&amp;Joy of Cooking (75th Anniversary Edition; 2006)?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven-Fried Onion Rings?#&amp;?#&amp;The recipe is more complicated than most, but in order to achieve the ultimate mac &amp; cheese, that&#39;s what it takes. The recipe utilizes three different cheeses: American cheese (for stability - American cheese has stabilizing ingredients), Monterey Jack cheese (for creaminess), and sharp cheddar (for flavor). (A fourth cheese is actually used - Parmesan - to flavor the bread crumb topping!) To keep the cheeses from breaking, evaporated milk (which contains carrageen or other stabilizing ingredients) is used instead of milk or cream.?#&amp;?#&amp;For the bread crumb topping, use 4 slices of white sandwich bread, 4 tablespoons (55 g) melted butter, 1/4 cup (35 g) grated Parmesan cheese.?#&amp;?#&amp;The rest of the ingredients needed are 5 Tbs. (45 g) all-purpose flour, 1 lb. (450 g) elbow macaroni, 3 12-oz. cans (1 L) evaporated milk, 5 oz. (140 g) American cheese, 8 oz. (225 g) extra sharp cheddar cheese, 3 oz. (85 g) Monterey Jack cheese, 1/8 tsp. (0.3 g) ground nutmeg, 1 tsp. (3.3 g) ground mustard seed, 2 tsp. (12 g) table salt, 4 Tbs. (55 g) melted butter, and 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of hot sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat the oven to 350&#176;F (175&#176;C).?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring four quarts of water to a hard boil. Dissolve at least 1 Tbs. (18 g) table salt into the water and add the macaroni. Cook until al dente (when the macaroni no longer shows white in center of the pasta when you bite into it but still has chew). Check the instructions on the package of your macaroni product and use the time listed as a guide. I generally start checking the macaroni a minute or two early to make sure I don&#39;t over cook it.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once it&#39;s ready, ladle out 1/2 cup water to be reserved for the cheese sauce later. Immediately drain the macaroni and rinse it thoroughly in cold water to stop the cooking. This is one of the few times I advocate using a colander and rinsing pasta with cold water (in most cases, pasta used in casseroles benefits from this procedure).?#&amp;?#&amp;Break the sandwich bread into chunks and pulse in a food processor with 4 Tbs. of melted butter and the Parmesan cheese until bread crumbs are formed. Set aside in a bowl for topping the casserole later.?#&amp;?#&amp;Shred the American, Monterey Jack, and cheddar cheeses. I found this was done fastest by using the grating disc on my food processor.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a roux by heating (over medium heat) 4 Tbs. butter until it foams. Then stir in the flour and cook while stirring until light brown (about 1 minute).?#&amp;?#&amp;Slowly add evaporated milk while stirring until all the evaporated milk has been added to the pot and no clumps of roux remain. Stir in the hot sauce, nutmeg, mustard, and salt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook the mixture for about 4 more minutes on medium heat. The mixture (a b&#233;chamel sauce) should have thickened up.?#&amp;?#&amp;Move the pot off the heat source and stir in the grated cheeses and 1/2 cup reserve water. Keep stirring until the cheese completely melts into the bechamel.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir in the cooked macaroni so that the sauce completely coats all the pasta.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the macaroni and cheese into a 9x13-in. baking pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cover the top of the macaroni and cheese with the bread crumb mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake for 25 minutes (when the edges begin to bubble). Remove from the oven and let the casserole sit for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into it to serve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">First, I started with a tomato salsa recipe from Cooks Illustrated. The recipe called for tomato, jalapeno chile, garlic, red onion, cilantro, salt and pepper, and lime juice.?#&amp;?#&amp;My tools (from left to right): Board scraper (to move prepared ingredients to bowls, clear the board, and scrape it clean), Paring knife (to core tomatoes and remove membrane from the chile), Chef&#39;s knife, and a teaspoon (to remove seeds and ribs from the chile).?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Ingredient Substitutions?#&amp;?#&amp;Ratatouille?#&amp;?#&amp;Kapoosh Knife Block (not recommended)?#&amp;?#&amp;Shrimp Scampi?#&amp;?#&amp;First I diced the tomatoes. I like doing that in the following steps:?#&amp;?#&amp;Each tomato is sliced in half.?#&amp;Tomatoes are then placed face (the cut part) down and sliced parallel to the board in 3/8&quot; widths?#&amp;Two at a time, the tomato rounds are sliced into 3/8&quot; strips?#&amp;Then rotated, and sliced into 3/8&quot; cubes?#&amp;?#&amp;I then placed the diced tomatoes into a collander over a bowl to allow excess moisture to remove itself. About 30 minutes should do it.?#&amp;?#&amp;I then diced the onions. Keeping the &quot;base&quot; of the onion intact, I sliced 3/8&quot; parallel cuts into the onion followed by 3/8&quot; vertical cuts. Since I didn&#39;t cut through the base, the onion held mostly together. Slicing through the onion at this point produced a suitably even dice.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, I minced the garlic. Cutting the garlic is performed in a similar manner as dicing the onions, except with smaller distances.?#&amp;?#&amp;I then cut the chile in half lengthwise and used my teaspoon to remove the seeds and ribs. These I placed aside for use later to adjust the hotness of the salsa. I then pressed each chile half flat and using a paring knife removed the bitter membrane from the inside of the chile. The chile in this state should have a &quot;fruity&quot; taste with a hint of spicyness. I julienned (cut into long strips) the pepper halves and then minced.?#&amp;Grabbing a small handful of cilantro, I bunched it up and just sliced away to produce the chopped cilantro I needed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Then, I threw the garlic, onion, and cilantro on top of the tomatoes as they finish draining.?#&amp;?#&amp;After the tomatoes have drained for thirty minutes, I poured out the liquid from the bowl emptied the contents of the collander into the bowl. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt (I find it easier to sprinkle and manage than table salt), a half twist of my pepper grinder, and about 2 tablespoons of lime juice. I then mixed the salsa together.?#&amp;Now that I had the salsa, Tina and I both tasted it on Tostidos White Corn Restaurant Style Tortilla Chips. The salsa was pretty good, but lacked something. After mincing and mixing in two more cloves of garlic and throwing in some more salt, we found the optimum mixture of flavor.?#&amp;The final ingredients list ended up as follows:?#&amp;?#&amp;1-1/2 pounds firm, ripe tomatoes, diced?#&amp;1 large jalapeno chile, seeded, minced?#&amp;1/2 cup red onion, diced?#&amp;3 garlic cloves, minced?#&amp;1/4 cup cilantro leaves, chopped?#&amp;1 teaspoon salt?#&amp;Pinch of ground pepper?#&amp;2 tablespoons lime juice?#&amp;?#&amp;The chile seeds can be minced and mixed in for varying degrees of hotness. Tina prefers mild, so I only used a few of the seeds.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">A brief history of biltong?#&amp;They also used saltpetre and then of course they added the various spices including pepper and coriander which has come to be the signature taste of biltong today. Using this method they were able to take supplies along with them that would not spoil and easy to transport.?#&amp;While we no longer need to make biltong for survival it has become a widespread and much loved snack and can be found all over the world now. Where ever there are Southern Africans you will find people making and selling biltong.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Peri Peri Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;OXO Good Grips Food Mill?#&amp;?#&amp;Tempering Chocolate?#&amp;?#&amp;Common Materials of Cookware?#&amp;?#&amp;Beef Stroganoff?#&amp;?#&amp;What type of meat can you use to make biltong??#&amp;Because there was a shortage of livestock in the early days, people began to look at other types of meat they could use including the local animals. As a result of this today you will find that any self respecting South African butcher will stock a variety of meats ranging from traditional beef to Eland, Kudu, Ostrich and many more. There are even specialist shops that will make biltong out of almost any meat including Giraffe meat.?#&amp;Having said all of this it should be noted that many of the different game meats are an acquired taste and I would recommend that you stick to the traditional sliver side beef when making this as this is the staple meat and one for the easiest to get right.?#&amp;I would also recommend that you buy the pre-made seasoning packs as people spend a long time working to get the right combination of spices for this. For someone who is just looking to give it a go them this is the best option. It is quite easy to buy this spice mix where ever you are, just look on line there are people who sell it.?#&amp;I personally like to add in some dry crushed chilly as I love spicy food.?#&amp;Biltong is best eaten with friends, if you are having a sports night with friends or a BBQ in the back yard biltong is the snack of choice. If you were to go to a similar event in South Africa there will almost always be biltong there.?#&amp;Making biltong?#&amp;What you will need to make biltong?#&amp;Two kg of meat if you can (silver side if possible; American&#39;s would most likely call this rump roast).?#&amp;1-2 litres of brown vinegar (malt vinegar).?#&amp;Pre made biltong spice (at least 45 g for every kg of meat you have).?#&amp;Wire s hooks to hang the meat with (must be strong enough to hold the weight of the meat).?#&amp;Flat bottom container big enough to hold all of the meat.?#&amp;Very sharp big knife to help you cut the meat well.?#&amp;Somewhere warm and dry to hang the meat?#&amp;There is a very definite process when you are making biltong, it is advisable that you have all of the spices and vinegar marinade ready before you start as once you have started you will need to see this through until the meat is hanging to dry.?#&amp;The other very important thing to remember is that making biltong in not science, it is an art and you will need to practice it to get it right. I will tell you this, if you get this right it will be worth it as there is nothing like it anywhere else in the world.?#&amp;Cutting the meat?#&amp;Cutting the meat right is one of the most important things to do in the process, depending on how thick that you make it will get you different results. It should be noted that drying meat will loose about 50-60% of its weight(meat is about 80% water remember. If you make the strips to too thin they will become too dry (unless that is what you are looking for) and too fat will mean that the inside will not dry and will still be red and wet when cut open(this is the way that I love it).?#&amp;Make sure that what whatever thickness you decide that you cut the meat as consistently as possible so that you get a stick of biltong that is the same consistency all the way through.?#&amp;It is a good idea to start with a medium thickness, I like to make them just over an inch thick and you really should try to make sure that there is a line on fat o</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">For these brownies, I used John&#39;s Favorite Brownies recipe from the Scharffen Berger website. This recipe yields brownies that are moist and chewy when you first bit into them, but also feel like they melt in your mouth due to the high chocolate content.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by assembling 6 ounces (170 g) 70% cacao content chocolate (could be marked &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;bittersweet&quot;), 6 ounces (170 g) butter, 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour, 1-1/2 cup (300 g) granulated sugar, 3 large eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Truffles?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Cake?#&amp;?#&amp;Caviar?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat the oven to 325&#176;F (160&#176;C). Butter a 9x13-inch pan. The pan can either be left as is, or dusted with flour or cocoa powder to help the brownies release after baking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Break the chocolate into chunks. Cut the butter up and place both the chocolate and the butter into a double boiler or a metal bowl set on top of a pot with simmering water. Chocolate melts fairly easily, but can seize and burn when heated too high. Melting it over steam is an easy way to keep the temperature at a moderate level. Be careful not to introduce steam into the chocolate because too much water can also cause the melted chocolate to seize.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir gently while the chocolate and the butter melt to help even melting. When all the chocolate and butter have melted, turn off the heat but keep the bowl over the hot water to keep the mixture warm and easy to work with. Stir to completely mix the butter and chocolate together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the sugar to the chocolate and stir in.?#&amp;?#&amp;Lightly beat the eggs and the vanilla extract together. Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the mixture and stir and fold until the eggs are blended into the chocolate. This step takes a little longer than the others because the egg will seem to try its best to stay separate from the chocolate. Using fast strokes to mix in the egg in the center of the bowl followed by a folding action to bring more egg into the center of the bowl works best for me. You also don&#39;t have to worry about the eggs curdling because the melted chocolate isn&#39;t that hot. Usually, when you introduce eggs to a hot liquid, you want to temper the eggs first (adding a little of the hot liquid to the eggs to help gradually bring the temperature of the eggs up) to prevent getting bits of scrambled eggs in your mix. With melted chocolate, this isn&#39;t a problem because the chocolate usually doesn&#39;t get hot enough.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the flour to the batter and stir until all the flour is integrated. If desired, up to one cup of chopped nuts can be stirred in with the flour.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the batter into the buttered (and floured) baking pan. Using a smaller pan (such as an 8-inch square) will produce thicker and chewier brownies. The baking time may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired texture.?#&amp;?#&amp;The batter will be fairly thick, so you may need to help spread it with a spatula. Place the baking pan on a rack in the center position of the oven and bake for 35 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;To check if the brownie is done, insert a toothpick into the center of the brownie. It should come with with brownie crumbs on it and no batter. (If your toothpick comes up clean, then you might have over baked it. Remove, cool, cut, and call them Chocolate Brownie Cakes.) Let the brownies cool in the pan before cutting them into 2-inch (5 cm) squares. Because these brownies have a tendency to stick to your knife as you cut, use a little bit of (melted) butter on the blade to keep the brownie from sticking. If any chocolate does start to stick, wash the knife and reapply butter. If you don&#39;t, then more and more chocolate will stick to the knife and you&#39;ll end up tearing whole chunks of brownie up as you slice.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">First, prepare a batch of chicken stock. The chicken soup used as a base for matzo ball soup varies from family to family, but most often I&#39;ve heard the use of a light, clarified broth. In my recipe, I like to use a very hearty stock filled with gelatin - which can only be attained through hours of long simmering. This additional protein provides a wonderful mouth feel to the stock and any soups you make with it. If you don&#39;t have time to make your own stock, make sure you buy a chicken broth that you enjoy, because it is the dominant ingredient in this dish. Good chicken stock equals good matzo ball soup.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven-Fried Onion Rings?#&amp;?#&amp;Beer Can Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Turkey or Chicken Stock?#&amp;?#&amp;Macaroni and Cheese Bake?#&amp;?#&amp;Clam Chowder, New England Style?#&amp;?#&amp;After the stock has been made, simply shock it down in ice water and refrigerate overnight. The fat in the stock rises to the top and solidifies. Prior to reheating, remove the fat (sweeping with a sieve works well). This chicken fat, known as schmaltz, can be used as one of the ingredients for the matzo balls.?#&amp;?#&amp;The matzo balls will need 2 matzos, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) chicken stock, 2 tablespoons (30 mL) vegetable oil or melted schmaltz (schmaltz will produce better flavor but, for many homes, may not be readily available unless you have just made the chicken stock), and 2 large (100 g) eggs.?#&amp;?#&amp;Matzos are unleavened bread made out of only two ingredients - Passover flour and water. Modern, machine-made matzos resemble large crackers or wafers. The matzos are unleavened (no rising agents such as yeast or even chemical leavens like baking powder) and are primarily associated with Passover, the commemoration of the Israelite exodus from captivity in Egypt. The word &quot;Passover&quot; refers to the passing over by the angel of death of the marked houses during the final plague visited upon the land of Egypt before Pharaoh authorized the release of the Israelites. The matzo is important as a symbol because the Israelites left Egypt in such haste that they did not have time to allow their bread to rise. In many countries, matzo is available all year, but in many places the commercial matzo found outside of the Passover season can often be non-kosher.?#&amp;?#&amp;Matzo meal from a food processor For this recipe, we need to grind up the matzos into a matzo meal (about 1/2 cup). This can be easily accomplished by sending the two matzos through a food processor fitted with the standard blade or using a blender. I did a quick experiment to see which worked better. The food processor broke down the matzos quickly, but even after a few minutes of pulsing, the matzo meal was a bit coarse.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using the blender resulted in a much finer grind, but took a bit more work initially to break down the matzos. Using two second pulses at varying speeds did the trick and within two minutes, the matzo meal was ready. Both methods will yield matzo meal that will work fine with this recipe, so use whatever appliance you have on hand. The only difference is that the coarse ground meal from the food processor may need to rest a bit longer with the liquids.?#&amp;?#&amp;Matzo meal from a blender?#&amp;In a mixing bowl, whisk the two eggs, two tablespoons chicken stock, and two tablespoons of fat (schmaltz or vegetable oil).?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the 1/2 cup (60 g) matzo meal to the liquid ingredients. At this time, you should also decide how much pepper to add. I use about 1/4 teaspoon as a starting point and adjust up or down as my mood dictates. Many people say adding more pepper helps increase the supposed curative properties of matzo ball soup. I don&#39;t know if it actually helps healing, but I do know ground black pepper does help clear the sinuses and it tastes good. Stir until evenly combined.?#&amp;?#&amp;Allow the matzo ball batter to sit while you bring two quarts (1.9 L) of chicken stock to a rolling boil. Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to allow a simmer and season with salt and pepper to taste. (I make</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">First, place two red peppers on the grill at medium-low heat in order to roast them. If the grill is inconvenient, you can place then under the broiler in the oven. Set it on low if your oven has multiple broiler settings. We&#39;re looking for a black charring around the entire pepper with some bubbling on the skin. Rotate the peppers about every five minutes to evenly char the surface.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start with one pound (450 g) okra, 1/2 jalapeno chile sliced into circles (use whole jalapeno for more spiciness), a minced french shallot, and two cloves of garlic, minced.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the peppers are blackened and bubbling, remove from the grill and place in a bowl. Cover the bowl with another bowl or a plate to catch the steam. The steam will help loosen up the charred skin from the roasted pepper. This step of roasting the pepper, really helps to heighten the flavor inherent in the pepper. In this picture, you&#39;ll see that I was in a bit of a hurry, so I took the peppers off the flame a bit early. It&#39;s okay, they are done, but it&#39;s a bit more difficult to get all the skin off if they are not completely charred.?#&amp;?#&amp;After five minutes, remove the skin from the peppers (using either your fingers or a knife to scrape it off). Then cut into 1/2 inch strips.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now that all the ingredients have been assembled, heat one tablespoon of oil on a saute pan over medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add minced shallots and jalapeno chile.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the shallots have nicely browned, add okra to the pan. Spread the okra out in a single layer. Cook, tossing occassionally, until the okra color as brightened.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the okra is bright green (but still crisp), about four minutes, add the roasted peppers and minced garlic.?#&amp;?#&amp;Saute for another two to three minutes and you&#39;re done!</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The name &quot;biscotti&quot; is Italian and literally means twice baked - which is exactly how we&#39;ll prepare it. Biscotti can be found in all sorts of flavors, but the most common contain anise, hazelnuts and filberts, and almonds. In this recipe we&#39;ll join the flavors of almond and orange (and chocolate). (I should probably also mention that the singular form of biscotti is &quot;biscotto&quot;.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by assembling the ingredients: 1 cup (200 g) sugar, 2 large eggs, 3/4 cup (80 g) slivered almonds, 2 tablespoons minced orange zest (about half an orange&#39;s zest), 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 cups (250 g) flour. You will also need 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 mL) vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon (1.2 mL) almond extract (not shown in photo).?#&amp;?#&amp;For removing the zest from an orange, I find that when using a Microplane Zester upside down (with the orange under the zester), the zest stays in the device making it much easier to judge how much you&#39;ve collected. If not using a Microplane (or a zester that produces comparably fine zest), you&#39;ll need to mince the zest for this recipe.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat the oven to 350&#176;F (175&#176;C). Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Caviar?#&amp;?#&amp;Basic Biscuits?#&amp;?#&amp;Shadowbrook Restaurant (Capitola, California)?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Truffles?#&amp;?#&amp;Select a mixing bowl that is large enough to hold all the ingredients and still provide enough room to fold them together without making a mess.?#&amp;?#&amp;Break two large eggs into the large mixing bowl and add the sugar. Whisk to combine.?#&amp;?#&amp;Continue whisking the sugar and eggs until the color has lightened to a pale yellow. I like using a spare piece of mesh cabinet liner to keep the bowl from shifting while I&#39;m whisking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the vanilla extract, almond extract, orange zest, and slivered almonds to the egg and sugar mixture. Using a spatula, stir once or twice to combine.?#&amp;?#&amp;Working in batches, pour enough of the flour mixture to cover the surface of the egg mixture. Use a spatula and fold in the flour using as few strokes as possible. Add more flour and fold until all the flour has been integrated. Folding is performed by using a spatula to scoop from either the side or the middle of the mixture and lifting and &quot;folding&quot; (basically movign the spatula laterally and then flipping it over to drop the mixture) onto another part of the mixture. Rotate the bowl each fold.?#&amp;?#&amp;The key is not to stir or mix the flour with the liquid too much. Gently folding helps prevents the formation of too much elastic gluten. The presence of too much gluten will defeat the delicate and crisp texture we are trying to achieve and result in a possibly chewy product.?#&amp;?#&amp;Split the batter in half and place the two rough balls onto a non-stick baking sheet (such as a silicone baking mat or parchment paper set in a half sheet pan). With your hands, form the batter into two loaves of approximately 10-in. (25 cm) by 2 in. (5 cm) each. Wetting your hands just a bit may help with molding the loaves since the batter will be fairly sticky.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake the loaves at 350&#176;F (175&#176;C) for 40 minutes (rotating the pan once after twenty minutes). The loaves should have just started to crack. (Don&#39;t wait for big cracks or you might overcook the biscotti.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the loaves from the pan and place them on a wire rack to cool for at least ten minutes. This cooling step is extremely important to your non-dominant hand as it will be holding the loaf while you cut it in the next step.?#&amp;?#&amp;After some cooling, move a loaf to a cutting board and cut diagonally into 3/8-in. (1 cm) thick pieces. Do the same to the other loaf. The interior of each biscotto should still be just a little moist (while the exterior is nice and hard). The crust of the loaf will probably be quite hard, so use a large serrated knife such as a bread knife for this job.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the biscotti with a cut side facing up on a half sheet pan and bake for 8 minutes.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This recipe is primarily dependant on dark chocolate, so be sure to use the best quality dark chocolate that you enjoy. I like Dagoba and Scharffen Berger chocolate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble the ingredients: 1 ounce (30 mL) heavy cream, 4 oz. (115 g) 70% cacao dark chocolate, 1/2 tablespoon (7 g) butter, 2 large eggs (separated into whites and yolks), a dash of cream of tartar, and 1/6 cup (35 g) sugar.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare two 6 ounce (180 mL) souffl&#233; ramekins by applying a layer of cold butter to the interior of the ramekins. Use your fingers to apply an even, thin coat of butter to all parts of the ramekin including the sides. Pour some granulated sugar into the ramekin and shake and roll the ramekin to coat the bottom and sides with sugar. Several sources claim that the butter and sugar help the souffle rise, but this is not actually true. The butter and sugar are really there to add flavor of the crust and aid in the release of the souffl&#233; from the ramekin (if desired).?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Truffles?#&amp;?#&amp;Orzo Risotto with Buttery Shrimp?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Buttercream Frosting (American)?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat the oven to 375&#176;F (190&#176;C).?#&amp;Bring some water to a boil in a pot. Once the water boils, reduce the heat until the water just simmers. Place a small metal bowl over the pot to form a double boiler.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt the butter, cream, and chocolate in the double boiler.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir to help the melting. Once the chocolate has melted, turn off the heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Whisk the two egg yolks into the chocolate.?#&amp;?#&amp;The resulting mixture may look like the chocolate seized, but don&#39;t worry, it will smooth out once the egg whites are folded in.?#&amp;?#&amp;In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until the egg whites reach soft peaks. (The cream of tartar is added to egg whites to increase the acidity slightly. This allows the proteins to bind together a bit more easily making stronger bubbles to form the basis of the egg white foam.) This can be accomplished with a bit of effort with a whisk (took me about 5 minutes) or a hand mixer with a whisk attachment. The term soft peaks means the foam has reached the point where the egg whites stand up when the whisk (or your finger) is lightly dipped into the foam and gently lifted out. The tip of the peak should droop. If the tip stands up straight, then it has reached the stiff peaks stage.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the sugar to the egg whites and continue to beat until you reach stiff peaks. Adding the whites a little at a time, fold them into the chocolate mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Without over mixing, fold the remaining egg whites into the batter.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the batter into the two prepared ramekins. Fill them at least 3/4 of the way up. They are now ready to be baked.?#&amp;?#&amp;The best part of making souffl&#233;s is that they can be prepared to this point beforehand and refrigerated for up to three days. On the day you plan to serve the souffl&#233;s, take them out of the refrigerator about two hours before you plan to serve them so they can warm up a little. If you don&#39;t take them out of the fridge early, then bake them for an extra minute or two.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the ramekins on a baking pan and place the pan in the oven on a rack set in the middle position. Bake the souffl&#233;s for 15 minutes at 375&#176;F (190&#176;C). As it bakes, the air bubbles we&#39;ve incorporated into the batter will start to expand, causing the entire souffle to rise. After fifteen minutes, the souffl&#233; will have risen up out of the ramekin (the photo shows an example of a ramekin filled to the 3/4 full level). (Greater lift can be achieved by using three egg whites instead of two).?#&amp;Serve immediately in the ramekin. (Ramekins will be hot, so use some hand protection to transfer the souffl&#233;.) As the souffl&#233; cools, it will drop and become more dense. An alternate method of service is to remove the souffl&#233; from the ramekin. This easiest accomplished once the souffl&#233; has cooled a bit and a knife has been run along the sides. The souffl&#233; can be inverted an</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">(although I did mess up while making this one)?#&amp;There&#39;s quite a few ingredients, so I took two pictures: sauce ingredients and layer ingredients.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Pan Fried Fish Fillets?#&amp;?#&amp;Basic Granita?#&amp;?#&amp;Mini Hamburgers?#&amp;?#&amp;Macaroni and Cheese Bake?#&amp;?#&amp;Shepherd&#39;s Pie (Cottage Pie)?#&amp;?#&amp;To speed things up, I use a food processor to finely chop six cloves of garlic (about 18 g) and then a large (300 g) onion. In addition, I use about 28 oz. of pureed tomatoes and 28 oz. of diced tomatoes (using either one 28 oz can or two 14.5 oz cans). For the meat, I use 1/2 pound ground beef (typically 85% lean) and 1/2 pound mild italian sausage with the casings removed (some markets allow you to purchase bulk sausage without casing which is convenient). I used ground beef from the round for the illustrations because it happened to be on sale. Ground chuck is also excellent. A 1/4 cup of heavy cream is also needed for the sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;For the layers, I use 15 oz. container of whole milk ricotta cheese, 16 oz. mozzarella, 1-1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, 1 large egg, and on 8 oz. package of oven ready (no-boil) lasagna pasta. I grated the mozzarella in the food processor and used a microplane zester to grate the Parmesan cheese. Avoid using the pregrated cheeses because they are often additives that keep the cheese from clumping and make them last longer, but alter the taste. The egg should be lightly beated with a fork. We&#39;ll come back to these ingredients in a few minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;First, heat a large pan or pot (a dutch oven works well) over medium flame. I used a six quart saute pan for this article. Pour 1 tablespoon oil into the heated pan. After it begins to shimmer, put the finely chopped onions into the pan. Cook for about two minutes, stirring occasionally. We want the onions to soften but not brown.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add garlic at this point and cook for another two minutes - stirring occassionally. Try not to brown the garlic.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the garlic is fragrant, add the ground meat and increase heat to medium-high. Break up any large clumps of meat while stirring. I use a wooden spoon and just jab at any large pieces. Add salt and pepper to taste (I like about 1/2 teaspoon of each). Cook until the meat loses it&#39;s pink color, but not start to brown (about three to four minutes). Now stir in 1/4 cup heavy cream to help hold the meats together a bit. Allow the mixture to simmer and thicken until most of the water in the cream has evaporated.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, add a can of pureed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes (drained). Stir the mixture until evenly distributed and bring to a simmer. After bubbles begin to form, lower the heat to low and cook for a few more minutes. The sauce is now done and we can set this aside to work on the layers.?#&amp;?#&amp;For the layers, put the ricotta cheese, a cup of parmesan (reserving 1/4 cup for use later), the chopped basil, beaten egg, and some salt and pepper (about 1/2 teaspoon each works well) into a medium bowl for mixing.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix the ricotta and flavorings together with a fork, spoon or spatula until it&#39;s relatively smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, we&#39;re ready to build the lasagna. Most of the time, people build the lasagna in the 13 x 9 in. baking pan, but I saw an episode of America&#39;s Test Kitchen where they prepared the layers outside of the pan. This turns out to be an easy and fast way of putting the layers together (also works if you have a helper in the kitchen - one person can prepare the layers while the other builds the lasagna). This method starts by laying out all twelve pieces of the lasagna pasta. Then spoon the ricotta mix unto each pasta piece - about two tablespoons each. Distribute any excess evenly and flatten the ricotta onto each pasta piece.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assembling the lasagna is easy, but pay attention to what you are doing and how many layers there will be (I didn&#39;t and ran out of meat sauce because I was too liberal with it on the bottom layers).

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Spinach can be quite dirty, so be sure to wash it thoroughly. Bagged spinach is often triple washed (look at the labelling to be sure) and is very convenient but can be much pricier than buying them in fresh bundles. I&#39;ve also found that fresh spinach can often be sweeter and more tender than when I cook bagged spinach.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Crunchy Bloody Mary?#&amp;?#&amp;Anolon Nouvelle Copper Stainless Steel 3-qt Covered Saute Pan?#&amp;?#&amp;Shepherd&#39;s Pie (Cottage Pie)?#&amp;?#&amp;Braised Brussels Sprouts?#&amp;?#&amp;Beer Can Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;The method is pretty simple and can be applied to a variety of green leafy vegetables (although most will need to have the stems removed, chopped up, and cooked longer to achieve a texture tender enough to be palatable). We love preparing turnip greens, beet greens, sweet potato greens, swiss chard, kale, and collard greens this way.?#&amp;Wash and dry (using a salad spinner is a fast way to dry leafy vegetables) 1/2 pound spinach. You can also simply just shake the excess water off the spinach, but there tends to be more moisture in the final sauteed spinach if you do.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mince 1 clove of garlic. In a medium pan (a 3-qt saute pan like this one works well), heat the garlic with 1 Tbs canola oil over medium heat until the oil is hot and garlic is slightly translucent.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add spinach to the pan until it is filled to the rim. The spinach will wilt and cook down pretty rapidly allowing more spinach to be added to the pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Use tongs to turn the spinach and mix it up a bit so some of the fresh spinach that was just added gets a chance to cook on the bottom of the pan. Continue to add spinach until all of it is in the pan. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the spinach (about 1/8 tsp). The moisture that is released from the spinach as it cooks should dissolve the salt and allow it to be evenly spread as the spinach is turned and mixed by the tongs.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once all the spinach has cooked down (1 to 3 minutes) and turned a dark, saturated green color, the dish is done. If cooking more than 1/2 pound spinach (just scale up the garlic and the salt proportionally), I find that cooking in batches works better than a lot at once, but with some practice cooking a large batch in a large pot can be just as easy.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The key to these biscuits is the use of lard. I use leaf lard rendered from the kidney fat of pasture raised Berkshire pigs. The lard is unhydrogenated and has no additives and features a clean, almost sweet, taste. Frying with this lard and making pastries with it adds a delicate, pleasant flavor that the supermarket lard (in my area the only brands available are Armour and Farmer John which are both partially hydrogenated and taste very &quot;porky&quot;) just cannot match. If high quality lard isn&#39;t available in your area, I recommend substituting the lard in this recipe with butter. The biscuits will be a little chewier, but the butter flavor will be more pronounced (but will lack the subtle flavors that lard contributes). I&#39;m not a fan of using vegetable shortening even though the texture will be better than using all-butter, because it contributes no flavor.?#&amp;?#&amp;The ingredients are simple: 2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour, 1 cup (235 mL) buttermilk, 2 ounces (55 g) leaf lard, 2 tablespoons (28 g) unsalted butter, 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) table salt, 4 teaspoons (18 g) baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon (2.3 g) baking soda.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Sous Vide Cooking at Home Setup Guide?#&amp;?#&amp;Understanding Blender Specifications?#&amp;?#&amp;Basic Biscuits?#&amp;?#&amp;Traditional Chicken Pot Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;If you don&#39;t have any buttermilk, you can just substitute 1 cup (235 mL) milk for it. Or 1 tablespoon (15 mL) lemon juice with enough milk to make one cup (235 mL) which has been allowed to sit for ten minutes. 1/2 cup (120 mL) plain yogurt and 1/2 cup milk also works well as does 1/2 cup yogurt. When I don&#39;t have buttermilk, I just use milk but if any of these other ingredients are available, they&#39;re just as good (some prefer yogurt over buttermilk - but if I did that, I&#39;d have to change the name of the recipe).?#&amp;?#&amp;In a mixing bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together until well combined.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the butter and lard to the flour and cut it in until only pea-sized or smaller clumps are visible.?#&amp;?#&amp;I accomplish this by tossing the flour around the fats until they are fully coated. Then I start to cut and press them using a spoon or knife. While cutting, I stir to keep the pieces coated with flour.?#&amp;?#&amp;Here&#39;s what it looks like when the fats have been cut to the proper size.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the milk into the flour mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir with a spoon just until all the flour is wet and it starts to clump together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a surface for rolling out the dough. I prefer a silicone baking mat that has been dusted with flour. This is also a good time to preheat the oven to 450&#176;F (230&#176;C).?#&amp;?#&amp;Roll the dough from the mixing bowl onto the floured surface.?#&amp;?#&amp;Dust your hands with flour and sprinkle flour on the exposed surface of the dough (which will be quite tacky at this point). Covering the hands with flour and dusting the dough will make it easier to work with. Don&#39;t be afraid to continue adding flour to the surface of the dough if it gets tacky to the touch.?#&amp;?#&amp;Without overworking the dough, form/roll it into a ball. Roll it over and flour the bottom if it is tacky.?#&amp;?#&amp;Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a large rectangular shape. Lightly dust the surface with flour.?#&amp;?#&amp;Fold the dough in thirds over itself and lightly dust. (This is like folding a letter twice to fit into a letter sized envelope; some people refer to this as a business envelope fold.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Fold the dough in thirds in the other direction (perpendicular to the direction of the previous folds).?#&amp;?#&amp;Press and shape the dough into a rectangle about 1 inch (25 mm) think.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using biscuit cutters, cut rounds out of the dough. Make sure each round has a circumference that is cut dough (that is, we want to make sure the cutter actually presses through the dough on all sides; an uncut edge won&#39;t rise as well as a cut edge, so we want to make sure the whole circlue is cut). Pressing straight down with the biscuit cutter helps make clean cuts </Data></Cell>

Livers and gizzards tend to go bad much faster than the rest of the chicken, so it&#39;s best to get them as fresh as possible. A quick survey of my local supermarkets revealed that about half of them carried livers fresh in plastic containers in the refrigerated meats section, but none carried fresh gizzards. All the supermarkets sold gizzards and hearts together in a plastic wrapped tray in the frozen meats area. These work just fine for this recipe.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by laying out your ingredients (clockwise from top left): 4 cups chicken stock, one medium onion, one celery rib, one red bell pepper, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, 1/2 pound chicken livers (about 5 livers), 1/4 pound chicken gizzards (about 6 gizzards), 3 cloves garlic, and 2 cups rice.?#&amp;?#&amp;Finely chop of the onion, celery, and bell pepper. Mince the garlic. Chop up the livers and gizzards into small pieces (to about 1/4-in. or 5-mm cubes).?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat a medium saucepan with a tablespoon of vegetable oil, butter, or bacon drippings until the fat just shimmers. Brown the gizzards over medium heat for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally to evenly brown. Add the chopped liver (the ingredient, not your sous chef), to the mixture and cook until the liver is just browned. Some moisture will probably seep out of the livers as they cook, so they won&#39;t brown up as nice as the gizzards, but that&#39;s okay. As soon as the livers aren&#39;t red or pink anymore, move to the next step.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the onions to the liver and gizzards. Cook, while stirring, for another couple minutes until the onion just starts to turn translucent and tender.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix in the bell peppers and garlic and cook for another three minutes while stirring occasionally.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the rice into the pan and stir to mix.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the rice has been completely mixed, pour in the chicken stock and season with the ground black pepper and cayenne pepper. Add salt to your taste. If this is a dish to accompany others, you may want to use only a couple pinches of salt, but if this is your main entree, then go ahead and use a teaspoon of table salt (assuming your stock was unsalted). Bring the stock to a boil. (If your pan doesn&#39;t distribute heat effectively, hot spots may cause the rice and food at the bottom to cook onto your pan. If you suspect that may happen, then stir while brining the stock to a boil.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the mixture is boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low - just enough to keep the mixture simmering. I check this by listening for the steady sound of small bubbles popping (or use a glass lid). Allow the rice to simmer for twenty minutes, then remove from the heat. Fluff the rice and cover again for ten more minutes. Serve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">(efsitz uses the larger &quot;sandwich size&quot; English muffin from Thomas&#39; English Muffins, but I chose to use the smaller muffin size.)?#&amp;First, we&#39;ll need two English muffins. I&#39;ve found that there are no English muffins like Thomas&#39; English Muffins. The supermarket brand muffins just don&#39;t taste the same. The term English muffin is a misnomer as they are technically not muffins (and not from England). Instead they resemble crumpets (also a soft yeast dough shaped into rounds and cooked on a griddle). In any case, either make your own English muffins or buy Thomas&#39; brand.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Bacon (Part I)?#&amp;?#&amp;Peanut Butter Cookies?#&amp;?#&amp;Dirty Rice?#&amp;?#&amp;Meat Lasagna?#&amp;?#&amp;Macaroni and Cheese Bake?#&amp;?#&amp;In addition to the English muffins, we&#39;ll also need about 1/2 lb. ground beef chuck. Ground beef chuck is excellent for making burgers because it is not too lean and not too fatty. If a burger is too lean, then the patty will be dry and bland to the taste. If a burger is too fatty, well, then it&#39;s to fatty. 20% fat seems to be the optimal amount of fat in ground beef to make an excellent burger. Technically, these two ingredients is enough for your hamburger.?#&amp;Deciding how you want your hamburgers cooked is important. Sometimes you want a thick, juicy burger, and sometimes you want a multiple thin patty burger that&#39;s been cooked so the patties have a crisp shell and the inside is done but chewy. I felt the latter would work best on my English muffins.?#&amp;?#&amp;I split my ground beef into four 1/8 lb. chuck patties and flattened them down into rounds that looked like they would fit the patty. (I did not make my patties large enough because they will shrink a bit while cooking. Flatten them down until they look like they&#39;re too big for the muffins.) Don&#39;t be too concerned with overworking the ground beef (which can be a problem with thick burger patties) since we&#39;re making thin patties.?#&amp;?#&amp;You can grill or broil these burgers, but heating a pan was easiest for me. I heated an empty pan over medium-high heat until water sizzled and jumped when I tossed in a few drops. Then I transferred the patties over to the pan and started my timer. I was going for well done since these were thin patties, so five minutes on the first side.?#&amp;?#&amp;The patties don&#39;t stick to the pan because some of the fat renders out. Once the first side is done, it should be quite easy to flip them over with a metal spatula. Five more minutes and the other side all also have a gorgeous and tasty crust.?#&amp;?#&amp;About a minute before the second side is done, any toppings you desire should be placed on the patty. I put some Pepper Jack cheese (Monterey Jack cheese with Jalapeno chiles) on top of my burgers. I then realized that I had some bacon left over from the Bacon Test, Part I and broke some pieces off and placed them on the cheese.?#&amp;?#&amp;Meanwhile, I had taken my English muffins and halved them with two forks. Using a knife produces a smoother finish on the muffin halves which doesn&#39;t toast as well or produce the famous nooks and crannies for sauce and dressing to fill. The muffins went into a toaster for a light toast and I topped one side with poor man&#39;s Russian dressing (equal parts ketchup and mayonnaise, adjust proportions to taste). Real Russian dressing should have grated onions and herbs in it. By the way, Russian dressing isn&#39;t from Russia... both English muffins and Russian dressing were invented in America by English and Russian immigrants.?#&amp;?#&amp;I stacked two patties on top of each bottom half of an English muffin.?#&amp;?#&amp;I slipped in a piece of romaine lettuce for a little crispy texture and plated the burgers with kosher pickles. Dinner in less than fifteen minutes.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This recipe, handed down to me by a friend in the form of index cards, was originally from the beloved Joy of Cooking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by chopping up 1-1/2 lb. potatoes into rough 1-inch cubes for boiling. Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the potatoes and bring to a boil. Once the water boils, add the potatoes to the water and return the water to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium to keep the water at a simmer. Cook the potatoes until fully tender, about fifteen minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;While, cooking the potatoes, prepare the vegetables. Use one medium carrot, a celery stalk, and a medium onion (a classic combination known as a mirepoix).?#&amp;?#&amp;Dice the carrot, celery, and onion and place in a bowl. Assemble the rest of the ingredients: 1 tablespoon flour, 1 teaspoon each of dried rosemary and dried thyme, 1 cup beef broth, and 1 pound of ground lamb or beef.?#&amp;?#&amp;When the potatoes are tender, remove them from the water into a large bowl, reserving 1/2 cup of the water. Mash the potatoes with 1 Tbs. butter, the 1/2 cup of reserved water. Add salt and ground white pepper to taste while mashing. I use white pepper in my mashed potatoes so black flecks of pepper are not visible in the finished product. Feel free to use the pepper of your choice.?#&amp;?#&amp;After the potatoes have been mashed, set them aside. Heat 3 Tbs. vegetable oil or clarified butter in a large pot over medium heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery and stir until the vegetables are coated.?#&amp;?#&amp;Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about fifteen minutes. This is a good time to preheat your oven to 400&#176;F.?#&amp;?#&amp;Increase the heat to medium-high and add the ground meat. Use a wooden spoon (or the potato masher you used on the potatoes) to break the meat apart while cooking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook the ground meat while stirring until no longer pink, about five minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Tilt the pot and allow the excess fat to run to one corner. Spoon off the excess fat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add 1 Tbs. flour to the mixture. Mix and cook for a couple minutes while stirring. The flour is added here to help thicken up the gravy that we&#39;ll prepare in this mixture. We cook it for a couple minutes during this step so there will not be a raw flour taste to our final dish.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the beef stock, dried thyme, dried rosemary, and nutmeg. Cook while stirring until the liquid has thickened, about 5 minutes. While the gravy thickens, add salt and ground black pepper to taste.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the meat mixture into a casserole or baking pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cover meat mixture with the mashed potatoes and fluff the top of the potatoes with a fork. This will allow the bits of potato sticking up to brown and form a crispy crust. Instead of fluffing the potatoes, you can use the fork to carve patterns into the potatoes producing a dramatic crust.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut 2 Tbs. of butter into small pieces and sprinkle over the top of the potatoes. Cover with a healthy amount of paprika. (Optionally, an ounce or two of finely grated cheese, like parmesan, can be used to top the potatoes.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the shepherd&#39;s pie into the oven onto a rack in the center of the oven. After thirty minutes, the potatoes should have formed the golden brown crust. Remove from the oven and allow to rest ten minutes before serving.?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Ratatouille?#&amp;?#&amp;Gravlax?#&amp;?#&amp;Clarified Butter?#&amp;?#&amp;Macaroni and Cheese Bake?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;For larger groups or potlucks, I double the portions and prepare exactly as above until the meat mixture is done cooking. Instead of transfering the meat to a baking pan, I put the potatoes into the pot to cover the meat mixture. (If I know that there will be many carb dishes at the meal, then I won&#39;t double the potato portion.) After fluffing the potatoes, I bake the whole pot for 30 minutes at 400&#176;F.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">September 30, 2005 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Like many people, I like braising Brussels sprouts in salt water for a couple reasons. First and foremost, it&#39;s a very fast cooking method. Using only a small amount water means the waiting time for bringing that water up to a cooking temperature is minimal. The Brussels sprouts cook fairly rapidly without becoming water-logged. Another great thing about this recipe is that it really highlights the natural flavor of the Brussels sprout without the unappetizing smell and taste that cause so many people to avoid this vegetable.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Smoked Beer Can Turkey?#&amp;?#&amp;Knife Covers?#&amp;?#&amp;Osso Buco?#&amp;?#&amp;African Horned Melon or Kiwano?#&amp;?#&amp;Buffalo Chicken Chili?#&amp;?#&amp;You can buy Brussels sprouts on the stalk or as individual heads. Choose heads that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. At this size, the Brussels sprouts are generally regarded as at their peak tenderness. Also, try to choose uniform sized heads so they will cook at the same rate. The heads should be composed of green leaves that hold together tightly. Try to avoid Brussels sprouts with loose leaves or leaves that are yellow, but don&#39;t worry too much since these leaves can be removed before cooking.?#&amp;For this recipe, I picked up a pound (450 g) of Brussels sprouts, a good amount for two hearty eaters. To scale the recipe, just increase the size of the pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you bought the Brussels sprouts on the stalk, simply cut them off the stalk. When I buy them as individual heads, I like to slice off the very base of the Brussels sprouts because the base has often lost moisture in the store and may be tougher and more fibrous.?#&amp;?#&amp;Peel off any loose or yellow leaves.?#&amp;?#&amp;Wash the Brussels sprouts thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or small clinging insects. (Some cookbooks suggest soaking them for 15 minutes in lemon or vinegar water to clean them of potential insects, but I&#39;ve never tried this.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Select a pot or pan that can hold all the Brussels sprouts in one layer. Put just enough water in the pot to create a depth of about 1/4 inch (6 mm). Cover and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is hot, add about 1/2 teaspoon table salt to the water. If you&#39;re scaling the recipe and using a larger pot, be careful how much salt you add. You want to get the water to be quite salty, but not so strong that if you tasted it you&#39;d feel that it is unpalatable. We add the salt after the water is hot because if you add the salt while the water is cold, the salt may not immediately dissolve. Salt crystals sitting in an aqueous environment has been known to cause pitting in stainless steel, so whenever you add salt to water (e.g. when preparing pasta), do so when the water is hot so the salt dissolves rapidly.?#&amp;?#&amp;When the water is boiling, add the Brussels sprouts to the pan. Make sure they form only one layer on the bottom and none of the heads are sitting on top of the other heads. Cover and reduce to low heat to maintain a simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;After about seven to eight minutes, the Brussels sprouts should be tender. The base of the head should allow you to sticking a knife in with a little gentle pressure. If you overcook the Brussels sprouts, it will produce an unpalatable sulfurous smell. (The sulfur smell comes from the excessive release of sulfur when overcooked.) Cooked just right, the Brussels sprouts should be sweet and nutty with a slight hint of bitterness (but not even close to the bitterness of many other vegetables such as bok choy).?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove from the water and toss in 1/2 Tbs. butter and season with fresh ground black pepper to taste. The addition of butter helps augment the nuttiness of the Brussels sprouts.?#&amp;?#&amp;Serve hot, warm, or cold - they&#39;ll be delicious at any temperature.?#&amp;I should probably note that the name is &quot;Brussels sprouts&quot;, not &quot;Brussel sprouts&quot; or &quot;Brussel&#39;s sprouts&quot; because they are named after the Belgian city of Brussels.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Dulce de leche (pronounced DOOL-say day LAY-chay) is Spanish for &quot;milk candy&quot; (word for word it is candy of milk). It tastes quite like caramel but with the additional taste of cooked milk. (Technically, dulce de leche is a type of caramel.) It&#39;s often used in liquid form as a sauce for ice cream, cakes, cookies, just about anything that needs a sweet topping. In solid form, it is most often eaten as a tasty candy.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Creme Brulee (Cr&#232;me Br&#251;l&#233;e)?#&amp;?#&amp;Condensed Milk Fudge?#&amp;?#&amp;Marshmallows?#&amp;?#&amp;GelPro Mat?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;The recipe most often passed around for preparing dulce de leche at home is to simply boil a can of sweetened condensed milk for three to four hours. This recipe does work, but a few details (and precautions) should be added.?#&amp;?#&amp;The label on the can should be removed if it is made of paper so it doesn&#39;t fall apart in the pot of water over the hours of cooking time.?#&amp;The can should have a couple holes popped into the top (using a can opener). This is important as it helps prevent the can from exploding.?#&amp;The can should be placed in a small pot and water added until it is near (1/4 in. or about 1 cm) the top of the can.?#&amp;The water should be brought to a simmer (not boiling) and held there for three hours (for thick runny dulce de leche) or four hours (for solid dulce de leche). Water will need to be added over time as it cooks off.?#&amp;Remove the can with tongs and allow to cool before opening.?#&amp;Cooked in the can, the dulce de leche will have different consistencies - liquidy on top, dark and crusty on the bottom. Stir together in a bowl until it is uniform.?#&amp;?#&amp;This is a really simple recipe involving very little interaction on the part of the cook. The downside of the recipe is that it takes about four hours for solid dulce de leche. Here&#39;s my recipe for making dulce de leche fast (potentially less than 15 minutes).?#&amp;?#&amp;This recipe also uses sweetened condensed milk as a starting point. Here&#39;s a 14 ounce (396 g) can. I&#39;ll discuss how to make your own sweetened condensed milk (if it&#39;s not available in your area) in a later article. Remember sweetened condensed milk (Ingredients: milk, sugar) not evaporated milk (Ingredients: evaporated milk).?#&amp;?#&amp;Just pour the sweetened condensed milk into a large microwavable bowl. The bowl shown here isn&#39;t quite large enough (see what happens), so get a big microwavable bowl. (It is possible to do this recipe with a bowl this size, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it on your first try or on a microwave oven where you haven&#39;t used this technique before.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Stick the bowl with the sweetened condensed milk into the microwave oven and cook it on medium for two minutes. Take the bowl out of the oven. Be careful - the milk heats up pretty fast so the bowl could be hot.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using a wire whisk, stir the sweetened condensed milk and put it back into the microwave oven to heat for another 2 minutes on medium.?#&amp;?#&amp;It&#39;s important to keep a watch on the bowl as it cooks in the microwave oven. If heated continuously (for example, on high), the milk will begin to bubble and the viscous liquid will trap the bubbles to form a heavy foam that sticks like hot napalm. That&#39;s one of the reasons why we run the microwave on medium instead of high. A microwave oven generally has only two modes - on and off. High means the microwave is continuously on, but a medium setting will cycle of microwave oven on and off every few seconds. The off periods help prevent boil over. If the bowl boils over, clean up the mess, upgrade to a larger bowl and continue.?#&amp;?#&amp;Here I&#39;ve moved to a 2.5 quart (2.5 L) borosilicate glass bowl and took a picture right after about 40 seconds of high power to show the foaming. The foam subsided rapidly, but you can imagine how high it was domed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Every two minutes, pull out the bowl and whisk until smooth. Then heat again. At some point (around 10-12 minutes into the heating depending on the strength of your microwave oven), the milk will loo</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In the United States, apple juice and apple cider are almost exactly the same thing. Apple cider should not be confused with the products known as hard cider (which is a fermented product known to the rest of the world as &quot;cider&quot;) or sparkling cider (a carbonated beverage made from apple juice). In fact, apple cider is a subcategory of apple juice. Apple cider is (supposed to be) the juice from apples produced by mechanical pressure. According to Wikipedia, apple cider is traditionally made from early-harvest apples and istherefore tangier than apple juice. In my experience and research, I haven&#39;t found any proof that this is true as a rule (although some brands will advertise that their cider is made from certain seasonal apples and prepared in a particular manner, I feel that these seem to be differentiating claims instead of applying to apple cider in general). Often, apple cider is associated with unfiltered apple juice, but you can find both unfiltered and filtered cider and juice labeled accordingly in the supermarket. In short, in the United States, there&#39;s really not much difference between apple juice and apple cider (speaking as a whole - some brands may differentiate their apple mixes to produce different flavors for their juices and ciders).?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Dirty Rice?#&amp;?#&amp;Cooked Egg Nog?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Truffles?#&amp;?#&amp;Classic Roast Turkey?#&amp;?#&amp;I like my mulled cider to be clear, so I generally use filtered apple juice or cider. I also use whole spices so they can be easily strained out before serving and don&#39;t leave a fine cloud or particulate matter and grit in my mulled cider. Some of the cider recipes that I&#39;ve tried use coffee filters, the assembly of a bouquet garni, and other steps that I think are extra. This recipe uses a single pan, a strainer, and a zester or knife. I like it when it&#39;s simple.?#&amp;?#&amp;To spice up one quart of apple juice, use one stick of cinnamon, about twenty whole black peppercorns, 3 whole cloves, and 2 tablespoons brown sugar. (The sugar quantity can be reduced down to one tablespoon, but I like it sweet.) In addition to these four ingredients, prepare some zest from a citrus fruit. In this example, I used the zest from half a Meyer lemon, but lemons, limes, and oranges all work perfectly. Use the zest from half a lemon, lime, or lemon-sized orange for each quart of apple juice. If you&#39;re using medium lemons, use about a third of the zest. Large oranges - use a quarter of the zest per quart of juice.?#&amp;?#&amp;Select a pot or pan large enough to hold all the apple juice. Toast the cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns to bring out their distinct flavors and aromas. Do this by simply heating your pan over medium heat with the spices in the pan. Toss the spices in the pan occasionally to prevent burning. The spices should become very fragrant within a minute or two.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the apple juice into the pan and bring to a boil over high heat. When the apple juice gets warm, stir in the brown sugar so it fully dissolves.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the apple juice is boiling, reduce the heat so it just simmers (small bubbles form and rise to the top in a steady rhythm, but not at a furious rate). Add the citrus zest at this time. We don&#39;t add the zest earlier because we don&#39;t want the brief hard boil to break up the zest to the point where we will have difficulty straining it. If you&#39;re careful, you can add the zest with the brown sugar and watch the temperature to bring the juice up to simmering but not to boiling.?#&amp;Maintain the simmer for thirty minutes. I do this with the lid off because it&#39;s easier for me to keep it at a constant simmer this way.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the mulled juice/cider through a fine mesh strainer and into the container of your choice. If your cider has a great deal of particulate matter, you may want to place a cheesecloth or coffee filter in your strainer (or sandwiched between two strainers) to filter out the fine particles. Serve hot.?#&amp;You can let the cider cool and then</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">In the United States, shrimp is sold by &quot;count&quot;. This is a rating of the size and weight of the shrimp. The count represents the number of shrimp in a pound for a given size category. For example, 41-50 count shrimp are composed of shrimp that weigh about 1/3 ounce each, while 16-20 count shrimp are an ounce each (or a little less) in weight. The lower the count, the larger the shrimp (and the more expensive).?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Albers Corn Bread?#&amp;?#&amp;Maple Syrup Grades?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;Baguettes Deconstructed?#&amp;?#&amp;Prime Rib or Standing Rib Roast?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring six quarts of water in a large pot to a boil. While waiting for the water to boil, peel one pound of shrimp, leaving tails on. Butterfly the shrimp by cutting the backs of each shrimp. While butterflying I also remove the vein (I think it&#39;s actually the alimentary canal) to avoid having gritty shrimp waste in my scampi. Rinse the shrimp and blot dry with paper towels. Once the water is boiling, stir in 1/2 tablespoon table salt and add one pound of dried linguine. (Cooking times for pasta varies by manufacturer. Use the instructions on the box, but be aware that many pasta manufacturers recommend cooking times that are to long for al dente. I suggest subtracting a few minutes from the cooking time and testing the pasta by biting down on it and looking at the cross section. There should still be a tiny speck of uncooked pasta when the noodles are al dente. Drain the pasta immediately; they will finish cooking as they stand.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt four tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of olive oil in the pan. Add about 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt (if using unsalted butter). Stir over medium-low heat until the garlic is lightly browned.?#&amp;?#&amp;The shrimp should be added in a single layer on the pan (cook two batches if necessary). The shrimp can be cooked over low or medium heat. Over medium heat, the shrimp will form a slight crust and be golden brown when cooked. When the shrimp color changes and the flesh touching the pan is no longer translucent (about two minutes), flip the shrimps over with a pair of tongs or spatula.?#&amp;?#&amp;Meanwhile, when the linguine is cooked to the desired level, pour the pasta into a collander to drain. Return the pasta to the pot or into a large bowl. When the second side of the shrimp is fully cooked (another two minutes), throw in one tablespoon chopped parsley and give it a quick stir. Remove from the heat and pour shrimp and butter over the pasta. Toss and serve with fresh grated parmesan, ground black pepper, and a slice of lemon.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">I did follow the traditional &quot;Texas&quot; style of chili making and did not include beans. This recipe is very thick, savory, and meaty. One of my variations is to use two types of chicken meat for added flavor and texture. I use the traditional ground chicken, and I also include whole shredded chicken from a store bought rotisserie chicken. If you prefer beans in your chili, please feel free to add them (I think pinto beans would be very good). I included plenty of aromatics (vegetables) cooked until soft and brown, and a good dose of Louisiana hot pepper sauce for heat. The addition of beer adds some flavor but mostly assist in deglazing the pan which is very important in this recipe since I recommend cooking this chili in a stainless steel pan (do not use a non-stick pan) in order to generate lots of those yummy brown bits (fond) that stick to the bottom of the pan (which is always a good thing!).?#&amp;?#&amp;Starting with a store bought rotisserie chicken, shred the chicken from the bones (discarding the skin), and temporarily store the meat in a bowl. If you feel the need to roast your own chicken go for it, but in this case, I think a store bought roasted chicken saves lots of time and energy.?#&amp;Some people (like my daughter) prefer to opt for larger cuts of meat and cut the chicken into cubes rather than shred. This option is up to you. I prefer the shredded meat because it adds a thicker texture to the chili, and also adds more surface area to blend with sauce.?#&amp;?#&amp;For the aromatics (vegetables), start with 2 carrots, 3 celery stalks, 1 red bell pepper, and 1 medium onion.?#&amp;The addition of diced jalape&#241;o pepper(s) is optional for extra heat.?#&amp;Cut the vegetables into a fine dice.?#&amp;(Discard the seeds of the red bell pepper.)?#&amp;Once again, the fine dice adds more surface area to the chili, which adds a more thicker texture, and richer flavor when saut&#233;ed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, mince 5 cloves of garlic.?#&amp;For the spices, you will need 2 Tbs of Chili Powder, 3 tsp of ground cumin, and 1 tsp of ground coriander.?#&amp;Add additional spices (plus salt and pepper) as your taste desires when the chili is completed.?#&amp;?#&amp;Finally you will need one 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, 1/2 cup of Louisiana cayenne hot pepper sauce (give or take), and one 12 oz bottle of beer for deglazing the pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by cooking the ground chicken meat in a med-high heatedpan with a little olive oil.?#&amp;I prefer a stainless steel pan so that the meat will form little browned bits (called fond) that will stick to the bottom of the pan and provide lots of concentrated flavor later on.?#&amp;Season the meat with salt and pepper.?#&amp;Make sure the meat gets good and brown (Browning = Flavor).?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Metrokane Mighty OJ (Not recommended)?#&amp;?#&amp;Kitchen Mysteries by Herve This?#&amp;?#&amp;Lime Marinated Grilled Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Beef Stroganoff?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;When the meat is cooked, reserve the chicken for later use.?#&amp;Use the same pan to brown the vegetables in the next step, in order to get the browned bits released from the bottom of the pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add 3 Tbs of butter to the pan and cook the vegetables over med-high heat, for at least 10 to 15 minutes, until the vegetables are soft, tender, and the onions start to brown.?#&amp;Once again, add some salt (and/or pepper).?#&amp;With a wooden spoon, scrape up all of the brown bits from the cooked meat which will add intense flavor to the chili.?#&amp;Browning equals flavor, so do not rush this step.?#&amp;?#&amp;Note the brown bottom on the stainless steel pan when you are finished cooking the meat and vegetables.

Then you have whole eggs, egg yolk or egg white in cartons already pasteurized. Conceivably, you can have peewee B brown fertile cage free vegetarian diet pasteurized organic eggs. The eggs I use here are Whole Food�s large brown cage free fertile produced without antibiotics or synthetic pesticides with a very light yolk color. The color of the egg shell is determined by the breed of the hen. Breeds with white feathers and ear lobes lay white eggs; breeds with red feathers and ear lobes lay brown eggs. Color of the yolk depends on the diet of the hen. If she gets plenty of yellow-orange plant pigments known as xanthophylls, they will be deposited in the yolk. Hens fed mashes containing yellow corn and alfalfa meal lay eggs with medium yellow yolks, while those eating wheat or barley yield lighter-colored yolks. A colorless diet, such as white cornmeal produces almost colorless yolks. Natural yellow-orange substances such as marigold petals may be added to light-colored feeds to enhance yolk color. I am as confused as anyone reading this article and dare not venture to say which egg is best for you in terms of nutritional value.

Try to pick clams of about the same size for uniform cooking. The best way to determine the freshness of clams is by touching the clams while they have their incurrent and excurrent siphons sticking out. Freshness is determined by the speed with which they retract: the faster, the better. If no siphons are visible, touch clams that are slightly open and determine their freshness by the speed with which they close. A third way is to pick clams that are closed. (If you cannot find fresh clams, then use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of canned ocean clam meat.)?#&amp;Approximately 1-1/4 to 2-1/2 cups of canned clam juice (If you used canned clam meat instead of fresh clams, you can also use the clam juice contained in the same can.)?#&amp;3 drops of vinegar.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">August 31, 2006 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">According to Nestl&#233;, the Toll House recipe originated with Ruth Wakefield who, along with her husband, operated the a lodge in New England called the Toll House Inn. Sometime in the early 1930&#39;s, Ruth was preparing cookies for her guests when she chopped up a bar of Nestl&#233; Semi-Sweet chocolate and added it to the dough. The result became the most popular chocolate chip cookie recipe in the world. By 1939, Nestl&#233; began producing the Toll House Morsels to make it easy for everyone to make this recipe.?#&amp;?#&amp;The recipe is actually quite simple and straightforward. Wet ingredients are mixed first until evenly distributed and then dry ingredients are mixed it. Lastly, chocolate chips and (if desired) chopped nuts are mixed in by hand. The interesting thing is that by altering the quantity of one ingredient (flour) we can achieve cookies of all sorts of different textures.?#&amp;?#&amp;The recipe calls for 2-1/4 cup flour (which is 280 g if the flour has been sifted or up to 360 g if the flour has completely settled), 1 tsp. (4.6 g) baking soda, 1 tsp. (6 g) table salt, 2 cups (340 g) chocolate chips, 1 cup (220 g) unsalted softened butter, 2 large (100 g) eggs, 1 tsp. (5 mL) vanilla extract, 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar, and 3/4 cup (165 g) brown sugar. The mass conversions are mine and, wherever possible, I assumed USDA Nutrient Standards for volume to mass ratios. The original recipe includes one cup chopped nuts which I chose to exclude from this recipe as I wished to make a plain chocolate chip cookie for this article.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Knife and Sharpening Steel Hardness?#&amp;?#&amp;Curry?#&amp;?#&amp;Peanut Butter Cookies?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven-Fried Onion Rings?#&amp;?#&amp;Wheat Flour?#&amp;?#&amp;You may have noticed that I was not precise with the mass of the flour. This is because Nestl&#233;&#39;s recipe only states: &quot;2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour&quot;. Is this flour sifted (as all flour should be before measuring), unsifted, or settled for one year and then packed down to fit as much as possible in a cup? I tested the whole range of flour density options starting with the USDA standard 125 g per cup (sifted) up to the maximum I could push into a leveled cup, 160 g per cup. Recipes (should) always use sifted measurements when providing volumes of flour because of repeatability. If a recipe used unsifted flour, it would be nearly impossible to replicate the exact same quantity of flour using measuring cups because it&#39;s impossible to tell how much the flour has settled. (See Kitchen Notes: Wheat Flour for more commentary on measuring flour.) Unfortunately, in the case of this recipe, it was clearly not written with 125 g per cup in mind. After testing a whole range of flour measurements, it seems that 160 g per cup (or a total of 360 g) of flour was the intended quantity. For those of you who do not use kitchen scales and wish to dry measure this amount - it&#39;s a little more than 2-3/4 cup sifted flour.?#&amp;?#&amp;Some of the early results from the first three batches This experiment did yield some interesting results (besides the trashcan full of excess cookies, empty Costco bags of Toll House morsels, and a colleague at Fanpop who ate over 2000 calories of soft, gooey cookies during two or three hours of coding). The less flour that went into the dough, the thinner, softer, and chewier the cookies became. In fact, several of the tasters actually preferred this style of cookie. This isn&#39;t the Toll House recipe that I was familiar with, so I kept testing, but I&#39;ve included the recipe for the thin chewy style (similar in consistency to the soft Chips Ahoy&#174; cookies that come in the red bag) down below. The procedure is the same as the regular cookies, just alter the amount of flour.?#&amp;?#&amp;Speaking of flour, take the 360 g flour and mix it with the baking soda and table salt. Set aside to be mixed into the dough later.?#&amp;?#&amp;On low speed, mix the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Ice crystal formation is the number one cause of poor texture in ice creams. Water in the ice cream mixture freezes into ice which causes a crumbly and unpalatable texture. In the worst case, it can be icy and grainy. The quest for the best ice cream recipe often revolves around trying to get the correct texture and consistency to the ice cream. Dissolving more sugar into the mixture lowers the freezing point of water, but can also make the ice cream too sweet and possibly soupy (sometimes even gritty if the sugar begins to crystalize). The use of binders like guar gum and carageenan, if not carefully controlled, can result in a goopy consistency and odd mouthfeel (and isn&#39;t always available to home cooks). Egg yolks are also used to bind water to fat, but the number of yolks needed to provide enough lecithin and other proteins to effectively bind all the water in milk and cream often results in an ice cream that has an overwhelming eggy flavor. Jeni&#39;s Splended Ice Creams at Home uses a few novel techniques to make the creamiest and smoothest ice creams around. First, she relies on casein and whey proteins instead of eggs to bind most of the water in the ice cream. By boiling the milk and cream, the milk proteins begin to denature and bind readily to the water (and evaporates some of the water as well). A dollop of cream cheese, which is rich in casein, is whisked into the mixture to provide additional milk proteins. As extra insurance, a slurry of tapioca starch is added to the ice cream base to capture any unbound water into a starch matrix. The inclusion of a little bit of tapioca syrup (which is an invert sugar high in glucose) helps prevent the sugar from forming crystals. All of this serves to make a homemade ice cream of unsurpassed quality, texture, and consistency.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Honey Pecan Pralines?#&amp;?#&amp;Clarified Butter II?#&amp;?#&amp;Ten Great Gifts for Cooking For Engineers&#39; Fans?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;When you make the ice cream, make it at a brisk pace. I had some difficulties photographing the process while making it at the same time. Some of the steps are easier with two hands (an impossibility when one is holding the camera) and other steps work better without pauses. (After you pour the ice cream mixture into the cannister, immediately start spinning it or it will freeze into place after a minute. Also, when scooping the spun ice cream out of the cannister into a container, do so as quickly as possible or more and more ice cream will freeze to the inside of the cannister making it progressively more difficult to scoop out.)?#&amp;The day before making this recipe, freeze the cannister from your ice cream maker. (This is, of course, assuming your ice cream maker is the type with a cannister or bowl to be frozen. Otherwise, you&#39;ll have to read the instructions on your ice cream maker and adjust the instructions for spinning the ice cream accordingly.) Prepare honey pecan pralines an hour or two in advance and set aside 3/4 cup for use with this recipe. (You can use more or less pralines depending on if you like a lot or a little in your ice cream. I suggest 3/4 cup as a starting point.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by melting 3/4 pound (340 g) unsalted butter in a pot over medium heat. This might look like a lot of butter, but we won&#39;t be using most of it.

Continue to cook over medium heat until the foam subsides.?#&amp;?#&amp;Allow the butter to sit until cooled and milk solids settle to the bottom. Some milk solids will also be floating on top - don&#39;t worry about that.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the liquid butter into another container without pouring any of the milk solids from the bottom of the pot into the clarified butter container.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">February 05, 2006 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To create toffee, we will basically heat sugar and butter until the sugar reaches the hard crack stage (300&#176;F / 150&#176;C). If you don&#39;t allow the sugar to reach this temperature before cooling, the texture will be different. For example, if heated to the soft crack stage (the temperature range just below hard crack), the candy would be more like a butterscotch than a brittle, crunchy toffee. (In some parts of the world, this is also considered a toffee, but it&#39;s not what comes to mind when I hear the word.) If the sugar is heated beyond 320&#176;F (160&#176;C), then it might not retain its solid form and turn into liquid caramel over time.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble the ingredients: 6 oz. (170 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 cup (200 g) sugar, about 1/2 cup (60 g) chopped almonds, 1 (5 mL) teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Condensed Milk Fudge?#&amp;?#&amp;Dark Chocolate Souffle?#&amp;?#&amp;Dark Chocolate Brownies?#&amp;?#&amp;Marshmallows?#&amp;?#&amp;Lemon Bars?#&amp;?#&amp;Select a small saucepan. Make sure the saucepan is large enough to contain about double the volume of the butter and sugar. As the mixture cooks, it will bubble and increase in volume - using too small of a pan may result in overflows.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt the butter in the saucepan with the sugar and salt plus a little (about 2 teaspoons, 10 mL) water over gentle heat. (Low heat is important to prevent separation later. Just be patient and let it melt together.) The extra water will make it easier for the sugar to heat evenly and melt together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir the mixture constantly while heating over medium-high heat. The butter and sugar will bubble and foam as the water boils off. This can take several minutes because butter contains a decent amount of water. The volume of the mixture will increase dramatically at this point. At this point the temperature should be relatively constant at a few degrees above the boiling point of water.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the water has boiled off, the mixture will collapse and thicken. The temperature will also start to rise again. The goal is to remove the pan from the heat once the mixture passes 300&#176;F (150&#176;C) and before it reaches 320&#176;F (160&#176;C). Use an instant read thermometer or candy thermometer to keep track of the temperature as you heat and stir because the temperature can change pretty rapidly once the water boils off.?#&amp;?#&amp;When the mixture reaches 300&#176;F (150&#176;C), remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the mixture onto either a silicone baking mat or a large sheet of parchment paper set on top of a sheet pan. The silicone baking mat is probably easiest to work with since it won&#39;t slide around on the sheet pan. If you&#39;re using parchment paper, one way to keep it in place is to dab the underside of the four corners with a little bit of butter. That will help the paper stay put while the toffee is poured on.?#&amp;?#&amp;Right after pouring, use a spatula (again silicone works best for working with toffee) to spread the toffee into a rough rectangular shape.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the toffee is still hot, sprinkle the surface with the chocolate chips. Wait until the bottoms of the chips start to turn shiny and dark brown as they melt from the heat of the toffee, about two minutes. Use your spatula to spread the chocolate. If the chocolate is still mostly solid, wait another minute before attempting to spread again.?#&amp;?#&amp;Spread the chocolate so that it covers the toffee.?#&amp;?#&amp;Sprinkle the chocolate surface with chopped almonds. If not using finely chopped almonds, such as the slivered almonds shown in the photos, visually inspect the the surface of the toffee to make sure the almonds are making good contact with the chocolate. Lightly press down on those pieces that are barely touching the surface of the chocolate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let the toffee cool for about twenty minutes until the sheet pan returns to room temperature. Slip the pan into the refrigerator to cool down and set for at least thirty minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove from the refrigerator </Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There&#39;s a variety of ingredients that can be used in this okra stew. The only essential one is probably okra (I use two pounds of the cut frozen variety in this recipe). In this example, I&#39;ll be preparing a chicken okra stew, but feel free to experiment with seafood (like oysters and crab or shrimp) or a vegetarian (stir-fried eggplant is fun to try) version. Start by preparing two pounds of chicken breast (about one whole breast) into rough 1/2 in. cubes. Also rough cut two green bell peppers and three ribs of celery, and finely chop one bunch of scallions (about 3/4 cup). Not show here, I also cut two medium onions into 1 in. pieces. (My eyes were watering, so I plastic wrapped the bowl and set it aside - forgetting to photograph it.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, cut one pound smoked sausage such as andouille or kielbasa into bite size pieces. Make sure you use Cajun andouille, not French (which is made of tripe and usually is not smoked and is not spicy). Apply 1 Tbs. oil to a pan and heat. Over gentle heat, brown the sausage. The sausage should have enough oil so the pan doesn&#39;t dry up while cooking. (If not, add a little more oil.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Meanwhile, pour 4 14 oz. cans of low-sodium, low-fat chicken broth into a large pot. Then add eight cups of water, cover, and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Carrot Pulp Cake, Part I?#&amp;?#&amp;Krups Spice Grinder?#&amp;?#&amp;Osso Buco?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicken &amp; Mushroom Marsala?#&amp;?#&amp;Traditional Chicken Pot Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the sausages are done browning, remove to a bowl and saute the onions (in batches if necessary) in the sausage grease. If there&#39;s not enough fat left in the pan, add some more oil as needed. Once the onions have become lightly browned (about 5-6 minutes), remove from the pan. Generously salt and pepper the chicken breast pieces and saute in the same pan at medium heat. When the outside of the chicken pieces have changed color, you can remove the pan from the heat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Hopefully, the broth is boiling at this point. (If not, use this opportunity to saute the okra until golden. Saute the celery as well if the broth isn&#39;t boiling yet.) Pour the chopped okra into the broth along with the sauteed onions, bell peppers, and celery. When the mixture begins to boil again, add the chicken and bring the heat down to maintain a simmer. Stirring occasionally, simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes. (The sausage can be added at this point if you don&#39;t like salty sausage. The flavor will infuse into the soup. Adding the sausage later will maintain more of the flavor concentrated in the sausage and less spread out in the soup.)?#&amp;?#&amp;After the soup has thickened (it should form strings when poured slowly from a ladle) and the chicken cooked, add the finely chopped scallions with the sausage. Salt and pepper to taste and simmer for five additional minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;The final okra stew is served great over rice, but (if seasoned with a light hand) is also an excellent soup for cold winter days. Adding hot sauce or ground chile to the broth is a great way to spice up this dish.</Data></Cell>

Cook until tender.?#&amp;?#&amp;Putting the canned tomatoes aside, whisk the ingredients together and pour into the saucepan. Add the tomatoes with the juice in the can. Optionally, you can add 1/8&#160;cup orange juice (or my favorite, pineapple juice) at this point. Stir over high heat until ingredients are integrated and begins to boil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Reduce heat to low and allow to simmer uncovered. Simmer for two or more hours (stirring occassionally) until the sauce thickens to the desired level.?#&amp;?#&amp;Although, the onions and tomatoes have probably disintegrated into the sauce, let the sauce cool a bit and pour into a bar blender for a quick puree.?#&amp;?#&amp;This final barbecue sauce is rich and flavorful. I find that it start out with a sharp tangy flavor from the tomatoes followed by sweet molasses and punctuated with chili pepper spices at the end. Adding liquid smoke and other flavorings (or removing the spices) will tailor the sauce to your tastes.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To prepare enough buttercream to frost a two layer 9-in. round cake (or a three layer 8-in. round cake), you&#39;ll need one pound (450 g) unsalted butter, four large eggs, 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) table salt, and 2 tsp. pure vanilla extract.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by cracking all four eggs into the metal bowl of a stand mixer. Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla extract to the bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Whisk until the eggs, sugar, salt, and extract are evenly combined.?#&amp;?#&amp;Find a pot that the mixing bowl can sit on without touching the bottom of the pan. Pour about 1/2-in. (about 1 cm) water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and place the mixing bowl over the water pot to form a double boiler. This will allow us to heat the eggs slowly, minimizing the chances that the egg proteins will tighten up (forming scrambled eggs). Whisk continuously over the steaming water until the eggs reach 160&#176;F as measured by an instant read thermometer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the mixture reaches 160&#176;F, take it off the heat and beat on medium-high with the flat beater attachment for five minutes. The egg mixture will turn light yellow and fluffy. The mixture should have cooled by this time. Touch the side of the mixing bowl to check the temperature. If the mixture is too warm, it will melt the butter while you add it and the buttercream might not come together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Reduce the mixer&#39;s speed to low and begin cutting pieces of butter into the mixer, waiting for ten to fifteen seconds before adding the next piece. One pound of butter should be cut into about 16 to 20 pieces (about 2 Tbs. per piece). During this process, the mixture will become lumpy, but don&#39;t worry about it, continue to cut pieces of butter into the mix until all the butter has been incorporated.?#&amp;?#&amp;After all the butter has mixed in, continue to run the mixer until the mixture turns smooth and silky.?#&amp;The final buttercream should be easy to spread onto the cake and should taste distinctly of sweet butter without any lumps or grittiness.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">June 27, 2013 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Because the ingredient list to make Espresso Brownies is quite short, it is important the ingredients are of the highest quality you can find, especially the espresso. Believe it or not, I started making this recipe by roasting my own espresso beans. This is not for everyone, but it is an interesting process to undertake. I roasted a quarter pound of unroasted green coffee beans in a Behmor 1600 electric coffee roaster. The roasted coffee beans then sat for four days in a canister so they could give off carbon dioxide in a post-roast process called outgassing.?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, I ground the freshly roasted coffee and used a Chemex pour-over preparation invented by a German chemist in 1941. The borosilicate glass carafe is inert and does not impart any flavor to the final brew. Espresso blends may be prepared using other coffee making methods too; you do not have to have an espresso machine at home.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once you have prepared the espresso, pre-heat your oven to 350F and select the pan you will use. A common size used for baking brownies is a 9-inch square pan. Other pans equivalents are: 11x7-in baking dish, 9-in round 2-in deep-dish pie plate, or 9x5-in loaf pan. I used an 8x8x2-in glass Pyrex knowing these Espresso Brownies would turn out even gooier.?#&amp;?#&amp;Gather the ingredients together. The dry: 1/4 tsp. (1.3 g) baking soda, 1/2 cup (80 g) all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup (80 g) cocoa powder, and 1/4 tsp. (1.5 g) table salt. And, the wet: 1/4 tsp. (2.5 mL) vanilla extract, 2 oz. (60 mL) prepared espresso or strong coffee, 4 oz (115 g) unsalted butter, 1 cup (200 g) sugar, and 2 large (100 g) eggs.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir together the melted butter, sugar, vanilla and prepared espresso in a bowl. Add the eggs. A silicone spatula works well for stirring the wet ingredients and incorporating all of the dry ingredients. Take your time, it can get messy if you go too fast. When thoroughly mixed, use the spatula to spread the batter evenly into a greased pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Predicting the length it takes to bake Espresso Brownies is the trickiest part of the whole process. Depending on your oven&#39;s consistency, the pan size and whether it is glass or metal makes a difference in baking time. Pull the pan out after 30 minutes and visually inspect the brownies. Have they pulled away from the sides of the pan? Also check the center to see that it doesn&#39;t jiggle. Then use the toothpick method. Take a toothpick (or in my case a unicorn shaped corn on the cob holder) and insert it into the center of the pan. If it comes out coated in batter, bake again and check after ten minutes. If the center doesn&#39;t jiggle and there are just a few crumbs on the toothpick then the Espresso Brownies are done.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let the brownies cool completely in the pan. This could take hours or overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;Enjoy with a nice hot cup of coffee or espresso!?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;What&#39;s In Your Non-Stick??#&amp;?#&amp;Pakta (Barcelona, Spain)?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Salsa Cruda?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;Espresso Brownies?#&amp;?#&amp;Butter and flour an 8x8-in pan?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat oven to 350&#176;F (170&#176;C)?#&amp;?#&amp;4 oz (115 g) unsalted buttermeltmixmixfold inbake 350&#176;F (170&#176;C) 30 to 40 min?#&amp;?#&amp;1 cup (200 g) sugar?#&amp;?#&amp;1/4 tsp.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Assemble the ingredients: 4 to 6 veal shanks (about 12 ounces each), about 4 cups chicken broth (2 14-ounce cans is good enough), 12 oz. dry white wine (such as a chardonnay), 1 large onion, 1 large carrot, 2 large garlic cloves, 3 bay leaves, 2 medium celery sticks, and a 14.5-oz. can of diced tomatoes (drained). Sometimes getting a hold of veal shanks can be difficult. While preparing this recipe for photographing, I was only able to get veal shanks at one of the three Whole Foods Markets near where I live (and I had to try three times that week). I generally recommend getting 12 ounce veal shanks, but when the markets don&#39;t have much selection, get whatever you can. In my case, 3 smaller pieces and two larger cuts were all that were available, so I bought them all (leaving none for the next guy trying to find veal shanks to photograph). You can also use beef shanks (which is usually about 1/3 the price of veal) which will require about 20 min. longer braising time.?#&amp;?#&amp;Finely dice the onion, celery, and carrots. Mince the garlic cloves.?#&amp;?#&amp;Salt and pepper the veal shanks. You can tie up the shanks to help keep the pieces stay intact (as shown in the picture), but I usually don&#39;t bother.?#&amp;?#&amp;Begin to preheat the oven to 350&#176;F (175&#176;C).?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt 4 tablespoons butter over low heat in a Dutch oven or wide stock pot.?#&amp;?#&amp;Raise the heat to medium and brown the veal shanks by setting them into the pan and not moving them for five minutes. Flip the shanks over and brown the other side for five more minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;After browning both sides, remove the shanks and set aside in a large plate.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the diced onions to the pot and stir until golden brown. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to help deglaze the pot. If you don&#39;t get all the fond (the browned pieces of meat stuck to the pan) off, don&#39;t worry, the rest of it will come off easily when we add the wine.?#&amp;?#&amp;After about five minutes of stirring, the onions should be golden brown. Add the carrots and celery to the onions and stir until softened and celery is slightly translucent, about five more minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for one more minute.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour in the dry white wine and increase the heat to medium high. Bring the mixture up to a full simmer. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, scrape off any remaining bits of fond from the pot. Simmer until the wine has reduced by about half.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, and bay leaves to the pot. Stir so it&#39;s evenly mixed and let it come back up to a simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the browned veal shanks to the pot. Make sure the open end (or larger opening) of each bone is facing up so the marrow doesn&#39;t fall out during braising. The liquid should come up to almost cover the shanks. Bring it back up to a full simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cover the pot and place it into the oven. Braise until the meat is almost falling off the bone, about 2 hours.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the osso buco is braising, prepare the gremolata. Gather about ten sprigs of parsley (about 15 g), 1 clove of garlic, and a lemon.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mince the garlic and parsley. Zest the whole lemon.?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix together and set aside in the refrigerator to chill as the osso buco finishes. (Gremolata is a traditional garnish for osso buco, but can also be stirred into the sauce just before serving.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the pot from the oven (while wearing oven mitts) and check the meat. If it&#39;s not soft and practically falling apart, put it back in the oven for another ten minutes and check again. Remove the shanks from the pot and set aside on a warm plate to await service. If any marrow falls out of the bone, just scoop it up with a spoon and deposit it back into its hole.?#&amp;?#&amp;Boil the liquid in the pot to reduce it to a sauce. Stir in salt and pepper to taste. You can add a cornstarch slurry to help thicken the sauce (just mix 1 heaping teaspoon of cornstarch with a couple teaspoons of water and stir the mixture into the boiling liquid). The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon that is </Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The use of a beer can inserted into a chicken is an old barbeque trick to provide flavored steam to the inside of the chicken as it cooks. At the same time, the beer supposely adds flavor to the chicken. Problem is, I don&#39;t quite buy it. If the beer is giving off steam, then most of that steam is just going to be water... most of the beer flavor will just be concentrating in the can. However, it seems that it would be sacrilegeous if I used the beer can but left out the beer.?#&amp;?#&amp;The first step is to brine the turkey. Find a non-reactive (polycarbonate plastic, glass, or stainless steel) container large enough to hold the turkey. Prepare a brining solution of 1 cup table salt to 1 gallon water and soak the turkey in the solution in the refrigerator for four to six hours. (If your turkey has been infused with a solution, then reduce the salt content in your brine or just soak it in a container filled with plain water.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour out the brining solution and rinse the turkey. One convenient way to do this is to position a rack in the sink and place the turkey on the rack to rinse. After the turkey has been rinsed, let it dry by placing it on a rack on a sheet pan in the refrigerator overnight (or for eight hours). Alternatively, use a blow drier on cool setting (no heat) to blow over the skin of the turkey until dry.?#&amp;?#&amp;In order to prepare beer can turkey, a beer can is necessary. However, a normal 12-oz. beer can, perfect for a chicken, is a bit too small for the large cavity of a turkey. At my local convenience store, I found this 24 oz. micro-keg shaped can of Heineken. It looked to be about the right size, so I bought it.?#&amp;?#&amp;After pouring the beer into another container (a large measuring cup), remove the top of the can. I used an OXO Good Grips can opener to cleanly remove the top (it took only one pass). Removing the top provides enough surface area from which the steam can rise. The small opening made by the pop top just isn&#39;t enough of an opening to effectively provide moisture to the turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Deposit six bay leaves (broken up) and two teaspoons dried thyme into the can. Unlike the beer, the herbs will provide noticeable flavor and aroma while the steam helps keep the turkey moist during it&#39;s long cooking process.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Classic Roast Turkey?#&amp;?#&amp;Beer Can Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Braised Brussels Sprouts?#&amp;?#&amp;Knife Parts?#&amp;?#&amp;Thanksgiving Dinner?#&amp;?#&amp;Soak a cup of hickory wood chips in some water.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a spice rub by combining two tablespoons brown sugar, two tablespoons paprika, one tablespoon kosher salt, one tablespoon black pepper, and one teaspoon cayenne pepper. Mix the spice rub well.?#&amp;?#&amp;Rub the spice rub over the entire exterior of the turkey. Loosen the skin over the breasts and thighs and rub the spices under the skin. Finally, rub the remaining spice rub inside the cavity of the turkey.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour half the beer back into the open beer can (reserving half for your drinking pleasure). Not pouring all the beer back reduces the risk of spilling as you transport the turkey to and from the grill. Lift the turkey up and lower it onto the beer can.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the turkey on the grill. If using a gas grill, position the turkey over one burner, away from the other burners. Turn the burner under the turkey off and turn the other burners on low. If using a charcoal grill, start the charcoals (you&#39;ll need a couple batches of about 100 briquettes each over the course of the smoking). When they&#39;re ready, push them to the outer edges of the grill leaving the center available for the turkey. Make a container with aluminum foil (or use a metal wood chip tray) and fill it with the wood chips that were soaking in water. Place the container over the other burner or on the hot coals. My grill was not large enough to cover the turkey without the lid touching it, so I placed a V rack in the middle to prop up the lid. I also inserted a Polder Cooking Thermometer into a thigh to track the temperature of the tur</Data></Cell>

You can keep cooking to achieve the level of color that is desired on the cut side of the potatoes.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The ingredients for this dish are variable. Essentially, all you need is a can of cream of mushroom, rice, water, and chicken parts. Vegetables (like spinach and broccoli), aromatics (like celery, garlic, onions, carrots, and shallots), and spices (paprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, etc.) are all great additions to the dish to add variety and a little excitement.?#&amp;?#&amp;In today&#39;s example, I will be using onion, garlic, zucchini, and garlic powder as my add-ins. Start with one medium onion, one clove garlic, one cup rice, one can condensed cream of mushroom, four pounds of chicken parts, 2-1/2 cups water, and one medium zucchini. I used chicken thighs in this example but I generally prefer to use drumsticks for this recipe. I usually lay out the chicken pieces in the pan that I plan to bake the chicken in. That way I know how many pieces to use in the recipe. If there&#39;s time, the chicken can be improved by brining in a 4 cup water 1/2 cup table salt solution for about an hour. The onion is diced, garlic is minced, and the zucchini cut lengthwise twice and then chopped into 1/4 in. slices.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Skinless Chicken Breast?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicken &amp; Mushroom Marsala?#&amp;?#&amp;Leftover Cranberry Sauce Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Kitchen Scales?#&amp;?#&amp;Beef Stroganoff?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat the oven to 375&#176;F.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt one tablespoon butter in a large oven-safe pan. If you&#39;re planning on using a different pan to bake the chicken, then you can use a saucepan for this.?#&amp;?#&amp;When the butter foams and begins to subside, add one cup rice to the melted butter.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cook, while stirring, until some of the rice becomes opaque. The rice will become lightly browned while we cook the onions in the next step.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the diced onions and cook until tender (about 2 minutes). Meanwhile, whisk the can of cream of mushroom with 2-1/2 cup water until smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir in the minced garlic followed immediately with the zucchini.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the cream of mushroom mixture into the pan and stir to combine. (If using a separate pan for baking, pour the cream of mushroom mixture into the pan and then add the cooked rice and onions to the mixture. Stir until combined.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the chicken pieces to the mixture. Sprinkle the surface of the mixture with 1 teaspoon garlic powder.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake at 375&#176;F for 1 hour or until thighs read 170&#176;F. If using drumsticks, begin checking for doneness after 45 minutes. In general, it&#39;s pretty hard to overcook dark meat prepared in this manner, so don&#39;t worry too much.?#&amp;?#&amp;After removing the chicken from the oven, let it stand for about five minutes before scooping out the rice and chicken pieces. (Otherwise, the rice will probably flow everywhere, and it will be difficult to plate effectively.)</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This recipe assumes the eggs have been refrigerated and have just been removed from the refrigerator before beginning.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Cooking Tests: Soft Boiled Eggs?#&amp;?#&amp;Everybody Eats Lunch by Cricket Azima?#&amp;?#&amp;Creme Brulee (Cr&#232;me Br&#251;l&#233;e)?#&amp;?#&amp;Marshmallows?#&amp;?#&amp;Cheesecake, Plain New York Style?#&amp;?#&amp;Boiling eggs in the shell pretty much starts the same way - by bringing water to a boil. The amount of water is variable depending on the size of pot and the number of eggs being boiled. An easy way to determine how much water is needed is by placing the eggs into the pot selected and pouring water in until there is at least 1 inch (more than 2 cm) of water covering the eggs.?#&amp;You really need only about 1/2-in. (more than a cm) of water above the eggs for this to work well, but I find that some amount of water will escape as vapor while it is boiling and waiting for eggs to be deposited. Depending on how often you check on the pot, water loss can be substantial, so try to make sure you have at least an inch of water over the eggs before you start.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the eggs from the water and place the pot (with its lid on) onto the burner on medium-high to bring to a boil. The water is ready once it reaches a rolling boil (large bubbles rising cause the surface of the water to tumble and roll).?#&amp;?#&amp;In the original article I wrote, the eggs were placed into the water and boiled for 5 minutes before being shocked in ice water. After more testing with another couple dozen eggs, I&#39;m now advocating the following method:?#&amp;Once the water is boiling, place refrigerated large eggs into the boiling water, cover, and remove the pot from the heat. Allow the eggs to steep in the nearly boiling water for seven minutes.?#&amp;As soon as seven minutes are up, remove the eggs and place into an ice water bath. This will chill the exterior of the egg serving two purposes. When rapidly cooked, eggs, like most dense foods, do not heat evenly. The outside portions of the egg (the egg whites) are much hotter than the interior (the egg yolk). By shocking the shell with ice water, we lower the temperature of the egg whites to a temperature below that of the egg yolk and this causes the egg yolk to stop cooking. Otherwise, the yolk would continue to draw heat from the whites and raise its temperature while the egg white temperature lowered resulting in overcooked egg yolks.?#&amp;?#&amp;The other reason for shocking the eggs is that it causes a little bit of shrinkage in the egg, hopefully making it easier to peel.?#&amp;?#&amp;After about 1 minute, peel the eggs. I find it easiest to do this by tapping the egg lightly (just enough to crack the shell) all over starting with the fat end (I start here because there&#39;s an air pocket and I feel more comfortable using a little more force to break the shell without damaging the egg). I then run a thin stream of cold water to help pull away the shell and membrane as I carefully peel the egg. Be careful, it&#39;s not as hardy as a hard boiled egg due to the liquid core.?#&amp;?#&amp;If the soft boiled eggs are too cold after you&#39;re done peeling them, you can submerge then into the cooking liquid (which should be just around simmering at this point in time) to reheat. About two to three minutes will bring it back up to temperature.?#&amp;?#&amp;Served with a light sprinkling of kosher salt, a soft boiled egg makes a great addition to breakfast or a pleasant surprise accompanying your dinner entree.?}?&gt;?#&amp;If this is your first time using this recipe, I suggest cooking one or two eggs with this method first. Breaking into the egg, you should find the whites almost fully cooked (solid) with the yellow yolk thickened and viscous.?#&amp;Note: For individuals with a poor immune system, the young, or the elderly, it is not advisable to consume soft boiled eggs or undercooked yolks.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">We&#39;ll use Vanilla Wafer cookies (Nabisco&#39;s Nilla Wafers is the most commonly available brand) as a bottom crust for these cheesecake cupcakes. To make a dozen cheesecakes, gather up one pound (455 g) cream cheese, 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar. The cheesecakes can be topped with whatever you like - maraschino cherries, streusel, Hershey&#39;s kisses. I like to use mandarin orange slices.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat the oven to 350&#176;F (175&#176;C).?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the cream cheese, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract into a mixing bowl and beat on medium-low speed until creamy.?#&amp;?#&amp;Starting with softened cream cheese will speed up the process, but even cold cream cheese will eventually beat in with the eggs to form a creamy mixture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Cheesecake, Plain New York Style?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Cake?#&amp;?#&amp;Curry?#&amp;?#&amp;Condensed Milk Fudge?#&amp;?#&amp;Corn Fritters?#&amp;?#&amp;Place cupcake or muffin liners (also called baking cups) into each cup of a muffin pan. While preparing these pictures and reading up on other recipes, I read a recipe that recommended getting aluminum cupcake liners but removing the paper layer (aluminum muffin liners have an inner paper lining placed within the aluminum liner). I decided to take this opportunity to test out different liners: aluminum with paper insert, aluminum without paper, and paper muffin liners. Aluminum with paper is what I recommend (more on why later).?#&amp;?#&amp;Place a vanilla wafer cookie into the bottom of each muffin liner.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the cheesecake batter into each muffin liner. Fill to about 3/4 full. The batter should be sufficient for twelve cupcakes with possibly a little left over. Top the individual cheesecakes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake the cheesecake cupcakes for about 15 minutes in the preheated 350&#176;F (175&#176;C) oven. As soon as the cheesecakes are set, remove the muffin pan and let it cool for a couple minutes on a wire rack. After the pan has cooled a bit, pull out each of the cheesecakes and let them completely cool before refrigerating.?#&amp;?#&amp;While pulling out the baking cups from the muffin pan, I realized that the aluminum liners made it easy to lift up and pull out. The cupcakes lined with only paper cups were a bit more difficult to grasp and lift up due to the less rigid nature of the liner.?#&amp;However, the paper lined cupcakes peeled easily while the aluminum only cup had a tendency to stick to the cheesecake. Sometimes while peeling the aluminum lining off, it would tear the cupcake. So, for the best of both worlds, use the aluminum baking cups with the paper lining left inside.?#&amp;?#&amp;After chilling, the cheesecakes will keep for a couple days - ready for a quick snack or for delivery to your next get-together.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Gravlax (pronounced &quot;grov-lox&quot;) is from the Swedish name for this dish. Norwegians call it gravlaks and the Danish refer to it as Gravad laks. It literally means &quot;buried salmon&quot; and the name refers to the traditional method of preparation for this food: fresh salmon was heavy salted and buried in dry sand to ferment and cure.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Shepherd&#39;s Pie (Cottage Pie)?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven Temperatures?#&amp;?#&amp;Clam Chowder, New England Style?#&amp;?#&amp;Prime Rib or Standing Rib Roast?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Parasites, such as roundworms, can naturally reside in salmon regardless of if it was frozen or fresh. For safety, use salmon that has been commercially frozen or freeze the salmon yourself to at least -10&#176;F (-23&#176;C) for at least 7 days. Alternatively, you can freeze the salmon after you have cured the fish, but make sure you reach those minimum conditions. My freezer&#39;s not set up to go that low, so I buy my salmon frozen when preparing this dish. (The freezing kills the parasites.) Before you begin, thaw the salmon completely.?#&amp;?#&amp;For every pound (450 g) of salmon, prepare 2 tablespoons (about 30 g) kosher salt, 2 tablespoons (25 g) sugar, 2 teaspoons ground black pepper (4.2 g), and a handful of dill. For gravlax, use filet cuts (fish portioned with cuts parallel to the backbone), not steak cuts (fish portioned with cuts going through the backbone). In the example shown, I used a 1-1/2 pound salmon filet (completely thawed), so I set aside 3 tablespoons each of kosher salt and sugar as well as 3 teaspoons of pepper. There are a lot of gravlax recipes out there that uses all sorts of other ingredients to provide additional flavors. I prefer the clean taste of the salmon and encourage everyone to try this recipe first before adding more ingredients.?#&amp;?#&amp;Examine the salmon for bones by visual inspection and by touch. If you find any bones, remove them with needle nose pliers. Draping the salmon over an inverted bowl or holding the filet up with one hand so it drapes (like a towel over the arm of a maitre d&#39;hotel) will help force the tips of the bones up, making them easy to grasp and remove. Place the salmon on a large piece of plastic wrap (about three to four times the length of the filet) with the skin side down.?#&amp;?#&amp;Put the salt, sugar, and black pepper into a bowl and mix until evenly distributed. Spoon the mixture onto the exposed salmon flesh, making sure to cover as much of the exposed areas as possible.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the dill on top of the salmon. If the dill is too long to fit on top of the filet, then snap off the stems or fold the dill over. It&#39;s best not to chop up the dill. We&#39;ll be removing the dill later, so having large pieces makes it easier to work with. How much dill should you layer on? They say, the more dill the better. I don&#39;t know how many sprigs I put on the salmon, but, as you can see in the photo, the dill is piled quite high.?#&amp;?#&amp;Wrap the salmon, salt, dill sandwich up, tightly, in the plastic wrap. Take a second sheet of plastic wrap and wrap again. Place the package in a baking dish or container. You won&#39;t be baking this -- the container is there to catch the juices that will inevitable flow from the package during the curing. We&#39;ll be placing this in the refrigerator.?#&amp;?#&amp;Refrigerate the salmon for at least two days. Continued refrigeration in the package will intensify flavors. Usually, I can&#39;t wait longer than three days. At this point, remove the container from the refrigerator, open the package, remove the dill, and rinse in water. In short, just wash the gravlax. If any pieces of salt or pepper are stuck to the flesh, just wipe it gently off. Dry with a paper towel.?#&amp;I should probably mention, at this point, that many recipes call for the use of bricks or heavy weights to be placed on the salmon package. Some recipes also call for turning the package over every twelve hours to redistribute the juices. Both of these steps seem to be unnecessary. It may be blasphemy to say so, but you can achiev</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">As always, start by assembling the ingredients: 1-1/2 cups cake flour and 1/3 cup granulated sugar (to be sifted together), 1-1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1-1/2 tsp. cream of tartar, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1-1/2 cup egg whites (about 12 large egg whites). It is important that the egg whites are free of any yolk. The smallest amount of fat (such as from the yolk) may cause the white to not foam up and become a soupy mess. If the egg whites have been previously frozen, thaw them in the refrigerator in a bowl covered in plastic wrap. Then remove them from the fridge and let them warm up to room temperature (about one hour). Room temperature egg whites will produce a foam with larger volume than cold egg whites.?#&amp;?#&amp;Preheat you oven to 375&#176;F. Sift together the flour and 1/3 cup sugar. I like using a squeeze handle sifter because it sifts the flour into a neat pile and works quickly and efficiently because of its three mesh screens and blades. Sift the flour and sugar at least twice to evenly distribute the sugar within the flour.?#&amp;?#&amp;Whisk egg whites until they begin to froth. (Whisking in a copper bowl is supposed to produce the most volume, but my Kitchenaid doesn&#39;t have a copper bowl and I have no plans to hand whisk my egg whites.)?#&amp;?#&amp;When the whites start frothing, add the cream of tartar and the salt.?#&amp;?#&amp;Continue to whisk until the egg whites reach soft peaks. At this point, whisk in the sugar about two tablespoons at a time. While whisking in the sugar bit by bit, add the vanilla extract as well (the exact time you do it doesn&#39;t matter). Continue to whisk the egg whites until stiff peaks. (When a foam has reach soft peaks, a whisk dipped into the foam and lifted out, will produce pointed mountains or peaks that droop at the tip. A foam is considered to form stiff peaks when the mountains formed by the lifting whisk do not droop.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, sift a thin layer of the flour mixture over the top of the egg white foam.?#&amp;?#&amp;Use a spatula to fold the flour into the egg whites, about seven or eight strokes. Don&#39;t stir the flour in or over mix or you may collapse some of the egg white foam. The idea is to gently suspend the flour in the foam. Sift more flour onto the foam and continue to fold, repeating until all the flour has been folded in.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the batter into a tube pan and level with a spatula. A tube pan (or tube cake pan) is a special pan that has a center tube that is taller than the sides. This enables the pan to be inverted while cooling. Some pans have a removable bottom which makes cake removal easier. It is also important to keep the tube pan free of any fat. I have a tube pan dedicated to baking angel food cakes to ensure it is free of fat. Bake at 375&#176;F for 35 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;While the cake is baking, make the strawberry glaze. Assemble 8 oz. frozen strawberries, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1 Tbs. lemon juice and 1 Tbs. cornstarch.?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the sugar, water, lemon juice and strawberries in a saucepan. Stir to dissolve the sugar into the liquid while bringing it up to a boil.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the mixture begins to boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for about ten minutes. When the strawberries get soft enough, break them in half with a spoon to help release more flavor from the strawberries.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove from then heat and strain the liquid from the strawberries. Press on the solids to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Set aside the strawberries and return the liquid to the pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring the liquid back up to a simmer. Whisk 3 tablespoons of water into the cornstarch and then pour it into the simmering liquid.?#&amp;?#&amp;Increase heat and whisk until the glaze comes to boil. Continue to whisk while the glaze boils and thickens, about 5 minutes. Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. Once the glaze has cooled down, place it in the refrigerator to chill.?#&amp;?#&amp;After the cake is done baking, remove it from the oven and immediately invert the pan.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The major ingredients in almost all plain cheesecakes are cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, egg yolks, whole eggs, and either heavy cream or sour cream. The ratios of these ingredients determine the final taste (tangy or sweet) and texture (dense or fluffy).?#&amp;?#&amp;My recipe starts with a quick preparation of the crust. Assemble 4 ounces of graham crackers, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, and 4 tablespoons of melted butter.?#&amp;?#&amp;Break the graham crackers into small pieces and place into a food processor.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pulse the food processor until the graham crackers have been reduced to fine pieces (about 10 one second pulses). (The crackers can also be broken by placing them into a large resealable plastic bag and crushed by rolling a pin over the bag.) Then, in a medium bowl, mix the sugar and butter with the crackers until all the crackers take on a wet appearance.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt one tablespoon of butter and use half of it to butter the bottom of a 10 in. springform pan. Then, pour the graham cracker mixture into the pan. Use a flat bottomed cup to press the cracker crumbs down into an even layer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Use a flatware teaspoon to press in the outer circumference of the crust.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake the crust for about twelve minutes at 325&#176;F.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the crust has become fragrant and turned a golden brown, remove it from the oven to cool on a wire rack. When the crust has cooled, use the remaining half tablespoon of butter to butter the sides.?#&amp;?#&amp;While baking the crust and letting it cool, assemble and prepare the filling: 2-1/2 pounds cream cheese (at room temperature), 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1-3/4 cup sugar, 1/8 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 2 large egg yolks, and 6 large eggs.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the cream cheese into small chunks and place the pieces into work bowl of a standing mixer. Beat the cheese on low until smooth, about two or three minutes. It may be easier to beat half the cream cheese first, followed by the second half. Once the cheese is smooth, add the salt and about a third of the sugar. Beat until integrated and scrape down the sides. Add another third of the sugar and continue to mix until the sugar is mixed in. Then add the final third of sugar and mix in. Optionally, three tablespoons of flour can be added with the sugar to help add a bit of stability to the cake. Adding flour will not affect the taste or texture of the cake, but will reduce the likelihood of a cracked cake. Add the lemon juice and vanilla extract and mix.?#&amp;?#&amp;Scrape the sides down and add the heavy cream. The cheese should be much easier to work with at this point.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the egg yolks and mix until they are blended in.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now add three whole eggs and mix until the eggs have been completely mixed into the filling. Scrape down the sides and beat in the final three eggs. Now, pour the filling into the springform pan onto the cooled crust. A 10-inch pan should fill up to almost its rim with this filling. Lift the pan an inch or two above your counter or cutting board and drop it to bring any bubbles trapped inside to the surface. Place the springform pan onto a sheetpan (for easy handling and safety), and slide into the middle of an oven preheated to 500&#176;F.?#&amp;?#&amp;After ten minutes, reduce the temperature to 200&#176;F and allow the cheesecake to bake as the oven gradually reduces temperature (do not open the oven door). Bake the cheesecake until the center of the cake registers as 150&#176;F (making sure it does not exceed 160&#176;F), about 1 hour and 40 minutes. Feel free to use an instant read thermometer in the center of the cake - a slight blemish is worth a perfect cake. Note: When baking the example cheesecake, I kept the cake at 500&#176;F for only five minutes (thinking that the pizza stone would keep the temperature higher for longer). Notice that the edges of the cake had begun to brown, but the whole surface of the cake is still a light shade. This cake resulted in the texture of a New York style cheesecake, but failed to achieve the loo</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">An artichoke is the bud of a thistle plant with seemingly inedible thorny &quot;leaves&quot; (properly called bracts) protecting a mass of tough (and often sharp) florets. Artichokes (more properly known as Globe artichokes or French artichokes) have no relation to Jerusalem artichokes or Chinese artichokes (both of which are tubers consumed as root vegetables).?#&amp;?#&amp;Cutting open the artichoke reveals its anatomy - which has already been color coded for us. The green areas are tough and inedible (the bracts that form the outer layers of the artichoke). Yellow areas are mostly edible. These include the meaty base of each bract (where it connects to the base or receptacle at the top of the stem), inner soft bracts, the receptacle (referred to as the heart), and the interior of the stem. Purple and white (the area directly under the purple) means &quot;Don&#39;t Eat Me&quot; - these are what would have become the purple thistle if the artichoke was allowed to fully mature.?#&amp;?#&amp;Let&#39;s take a closer look at the center of the artichoke. The fleshy recepticle at the top of the stem where all the bracts and the florets (the choke) attach to is called the heart. The choke is inedible, so needs to be removed either before cooking or while eating.?#&amp;?#&amp;I start preparing grilled artichokes the same way as I prepare them for steaming. I typically start by getting an inch of water boiling in a pot with a steamer insert as I prepare the artichokes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prep the artichokes by using a pair of kitchen shears to cut off the thorny tips of each of the bracts. Cut about 1/4 of the bract off during this operation. This is done as a courtesy to the diner&#39;s fingers (and it makes the artichoke look nice).?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the bracts have been trimmed, use a large, sharp knife to cut off the tip of the artichoke. Cut off either the whole stem or just the tip (where it&#39;s brownish black). The stem is edible, but unless the artichoke is very large, the flesh is quite bitter. If you plan on eating the stem, just cut a little bit off the stem. If not, then you can chop the whole stem off.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Beef Stroganoff?#&amp;?#&amp;Boning Chicken Breast?#&amp;?#&amp;Pan Seared Scallops with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;Prime Rib or Standing Rib Roast?#&amp;?#&amp;If you&#39;re trimming multiple artichokes, you should place the trimmed artichoke immediately into some acidulated water (water in a large bowl with the juice of one or two lemons squeezed into it) to keep the exposed flesh from turning black or brown. I don&#39;t usually bother with the acidulated water - I prefer to simply place the artichoke into the pot to steam. As I finish trimming each artichoke, I add it to the pot. When I place the artichoke into the pot, I place it stem side up - they stand better that way.?#&amp;Artichokes can be steamed until they are completely cooked (anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes depending on size). Sticking a fork into the stem (through the cut side) and meeting no resistance at all usually indicates the artichoke is done cooking. Remove the artichoke and allow to rest for 20 minutes before serving.?#&amp;?#&amp;However, for grilled artichokes, just steam the artichokes for 15 minutes and remove. (While steaming the artichokes, preheat the grill.) The artichoke will be softened but not fully cooked. Cut the artichoke in half along its axis of symmetry.?#&amp;?#&amp;The artichoke will still have its choke.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using a melon baller, measuring spoon, or tableware spoon, scoop out the choke and discard. Be careful, the choke can make quite a mess if allowed to - just scoop and toss. If you miss a bit of the florets, use the spoon to scrape against the heart and the florets should come off onto the spoon.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut open and remove the chokes from each artichoke and then brush the cut side of the artichokes with olive oil, being sure to coat the heart. Generously sprinkle salt and pepper over the cut side and transfer to a hot grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grill over medium heat with the cut side up for 10 minutes and then flip the ar</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Last week I roasted a four pound cross rib roast (instead of a standing rib roast because I was too cheap to by prime rib just for an article). Well, I finally finished eating the roast. (After the initial feast, I sliced the roast into steaks and then reheated on a skillet for a couple minutes on each side with some onion powder and celery salt to produce a tender medium to medium-well steak dinner.) After eating steak (and grilled beef of several varieties because of the July 4th weekend), Tina decided she would like some fish.?#&amp;My main concern was that the fish would stick to the stainless steel bottom of the traditional pan. After doing some research, it seemed that the Editors of Cook&#39;s Illustrated (in The Best Recipe) believed that heating a traditional pan enough prior to cooking would allow the fish to not stick to the stainless steel. I thought it was worth a try.?#&amp;I heated both pans at medium-high heat. While the pans were heating, I seasoned the four fillets simply with salt and pepper. I poured about a tablespoon of oil in both pans and watched the oil until it shimmered. Then I placed two fillets in the non-stick pan and two fillets in the traditional pan. I started with the skin side up.?#&amp;Since the fillets were about an inch in thickness, I set my timer for 5 minutes. I let the fish sit there and cook, splattering oil everywhere for the duration before attempting to dislodge them. The non-stick was pretty straightforward. I picked up the pan byt he handle and gave it a firm jerk. The fish fillets slide about an inch on the pan. Then I flipped them over with a spatula and started another timer for five minutes. I then moved over to the traditional pan and gave it the same jerk. No movement. I prodded a little with my spatula and it seemed like the fish was pretty much sealed to the pan. I dribbled a little more oil in and let it cook for an additional thirty seconds. Then I tried the jerk again. Nothing. Not wanting to over cook the fish, I went in with my spatula and carefully wedged teh edge of the spatula under the fish. Working my way around the fillet, I managed to release it and flip it over. I did the same with the second. What surprised me was that the color of the fish on the traditional pan was a rich golden brown while the non-stick pan gave me a darker brown crust. It was kind of a pain to scrape the fish off the traditional pan without destroying the fillet though. I started a second timer for the traditional pan - also at 5 minutes.?#&amp;Once the five minutes were up for each of the pans, I removed them promptly onto a serving plate. In both cases, the fish were perfectly cooked - crispy exterior with almost flaking (but not quite flaky) interior. Also, the color from the traditional pan was a little better than the non-stick (although I couldn&#39;t discern a difference while tasting). However, the non-stick pan provides that extra insurance that a flip will be quick, easy, and efficient. In addition, the extra oil used in the traditional pan made for a bigger mess to clean up. When I usually use a non-stick pan, I will actually brush the oil onto the fish fillet and then pan fry without additional oil. This creates very little sizzle or splatter and makes for quick kitchen cleanup.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Chicken Marsala, like any dish that&#39;s been around for generations, comes in a variety of forms with all sorts of family secrets or preferences. I&#39;ve prepared the easiest, good tasting recipe that I&#39;ve been able to come up with for this dish and still be called a great Chicken Marsala. As in all the recipes that I post on this website, additional ingredients can be added to your liking. Not only that, I encourage you to do your own experimenting as well!?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;The Classic Tiramisu (original recipe?)?#&amp;?#&amp;Oven Baked Chicken and Rice?#&amp;?#&amp;Peanut Butter Cookies?#&amp;?#&amp;Beef Stroganoff?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicago 2011 Part 6 - Noodles by Takashi Yagihashi, Frontera Fresco, Marc Burger?#&amp;?#&amp;A lot of recipes call for thin sliced chicken breast meat. The breasts should be washed, patted dry, and lightly floured. The idea is that the thin cuts will not require much cooking time and the flour would protect the breast from drying out while it&#39;s cooking. This is true, but there&#39;s always potential for making a mess when you flour the chicken. I also found that flouring the chicken wasn&#39;t as easy as it looked. If you use too much, then the flour falls off in chunks as you cook it. Use too little and it seems like it was pointless to flour the chicken in the first place. My solution? Brine the chicken breasts, skip the flour.?#&amp;Brining is the act of soaking ingredients (in our case, chicken) in water with salt (and sometimes sugar). This soak causes salt to penetrate into the chicken meat and at the same time pulls more water in. The meat becomes more plump and flavorful. Brining a chicken breast prior to cooking makes it much easier to produce a tender, juicy breast. I brined my chicken breasts in a plastic bag with 4 cups water with 4 Tbs. table salt for one hour. After an hour, remove the breasts and rinse off the breasts (or they will be too salty).?#&amp;?#&amp;I brought together the three brined chicken breasts (about 1/2 lb. or 250 g each), 1 cup sweet marsala wine, and 4 ounces sliced button mushrooms. I did not cut my breasts into thin pieces (to show that it&#39;s not necessary), but some people prefer a thinner cut. If you&#39;re one of them, go ahead and cut your breasts in half and poudn them down with a meat mallet. The sweet marsala wine should be of drinkable quality. I cut the mushrooms into thick cuts, but quartering, halving, or even leaving the mushrooms whole work well.?#&amp;?#&amp;Salt and pepper the breasts. Heat about 2 tablespoons of oil on medium-high and pan fry the breasts for a few minutes. The exact time depends on the thickeness of the breasts. The breast will change color while it&#39;s cooking from pink to white. When the bottom half has changed color, flip the breasts over and cook the raw side of the breast.?#&amp;?#&amp;Here&#39;s where extra attentiveness is important. The objective is to cook the breast until it has just fully cooked. In the Grilled Skinless Chicken Breast article, I advocated learning to tell is chicken breast is done by touch. Well, here&#39;s where it comes in handy. If you know how chicken breast feels (level of springiness, hardness, etc.) then use this method to check one when the breasts are fully cooked. I once asked the chef at my local Buca di Beppo&#39;s how he made his Chicken Marsala so tender, and he responded mysteriously, &quot;You have to watch the chicken. No, really watch it. You will know when it is done.&quot; Well, I&#39;m saying you need to watch and press on it once in a while. If you&#39;re not familiar with the touch technique, then simply cut a hole into the thickest part of a breast and see what color liquid flows out. If the liquid has tints of color and is opaque, then keep cooking the chicken. If the liquid is clear (like oily water), then the chicken breast is done.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the fully cooked chicken to a plate and throw the mushrooms into the pan. Don&#39;t worry if there are burnt bits of chicken still in the pan because these will help flavor the sauce. If there are any larger chunks of chicken, remove them because </Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">First, we&#39;ll need to start with the spice rub. You&#39;ll have your preference, but here&#39;s the one I created. I use 2 parts paprika, 2 parts chili powder, 1 part light brown sugar, 1 part salt, 1 part ground black pepper, 1 part crushed red pepper, and 1 part cumin. The rub can be made in any quantity and stored for use later. For a small amount use a teaspoon, for a large quality use a 1/4 cup (or more) per part.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, I grind the cumin and red pepper in a spice grinder until powdery.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the spices together into an available spice jar. I had just finished a container of dried rosemary, so I used it after washing (and drying!). A salt shaker would work just as well.?#&amp;?#&amp;Laying out the pork chops, I liberally sprinkled the surface with the rub. Then I took one to two teaspoons of dried thyme and sprinkled it over. Using my tongs, I pressed the rub and thyme into the chops before flipping and repeating the rub and thyme sprinkling.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Barbecue Pork Ribs (Baby Back or Spare)?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;Eric&#39;s Chocolate Pecan Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Lime Marinated Grilled Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Rosemary Lamb Chops?#&amp;?#&amp;The pork chops should refrigerate for about 8 hours before grilling to help the flavors really get into the meat.

Move to lower heat and cook until an instant read thermometer registers 145&#176;F (63&#176;C) [336 K].?#&amp;Let stand for five minutes and serve!?#&amp;Please note that trichinella larvae (the cause of trichinosis or trichinellosis) can survive in temperatures up to 170&#176;F (78&#176;C) [350K], but this usually produces a tough piece of pork. You can avoid danger of trichinosis by freezing the pork at 5&#176;F (-15&#176;C) [258 K] for 20 days. This will effectively kill any trichinella larvae.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Start with 1-1/2 to 2 pounds of sea scallops. Clean the scallops by removing the small, tough muscle found on one side of each scallop (see picture below). If you don&#39;t peel off this piece from the scallop, then you&#39;ll have an extremely tough and chewy piece attached to your tender scallops after cooking.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, assemble the rest of the ingredients. Core three red bell peppers. Cut them in half and press down flat (with the skin facing up) onto a sheet pan lined with aluminum foil. Also, gather together 8 oz. sour cream, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, and a little bit of lemon zest. I also reserved a few sprigs of parsley for garnishing.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start bringing four quarts or more of water to a boil. While the water is coming to a boil, we&#39;ll roast the peppers.?#&amp;?#&amp;In the past, we&#39;ve roasted peppers on the grill, but, since it&#39;s winter, we&#39;ll roast them under the broiler in the oven. Place the sheet pan with the peppers on a rack in the highest position. If your rack doesn&#39;t reach high enough (the peppers should be within 2 inches of the broiler), invert another sheet pan and place that on the rack first to raise the level of the peppers. Broil until the surface of the peppers bubble and then turn black, about 15 minutes. Rotate the pan as necessary for even roasting.?#&amp;?#&amp;After the peppers are done roasting, stack the peppers and fold the aluminum foil over to seal the peppers in and steam them. Steam the peppers for five to ten minutes before peeling the skins off.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Brining?#&amp;?#&amp;Good Eats Peanut Brittle?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Porterhouse or T-Bone Steak?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Artichokes?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicken &amp; Mushroom Marsala?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the water comes to a boil, add a tablespoon of salt to the water along with a pound of fettucini. Remember to stir the fettucini when ever you get a chance to avoid clumping.?#&amp;?#&amp;In a large skillet, melt 4 Tbs. butter over low heat, then turn up the heat to medium until the foaming subsides.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the butter is brown and smells rich and nutty, place a single layer of scallops on the skillet and allow them to sear for about 2 minutes. If your scallops are truly fresh, then they should sear beautifully without releasing moisture faster than it can evaporate. Unfortunately, most scallops sold in the supermarkets are presoaked in water to give them a more uniform look at the store (and to increase the weight of each scallop for better profits). To big downside to the soaked scallops is that they don&#39;t cook well. The water tends to run out of the scallop and we end up either steaming or braising the scallops. If this is happening, remove the scallops from the pan after the first side is done cooking and allow much of the moisture to boil off before returning the scallops to the pan (with the raw side down). Sear the uncooked side of the scallops another 2 minutes. Our objective is to have the scallop turn opaque on the two flat sides, but leave a translucent center - medium rare. If we cooked them any longer, the scallops would turn stringy and lose a little bit of their natural flavors.?#&amp;?#&amp;While you are pan searing the scallops, remove and discard the skin from the red peppers. Place the peppers into a bar blender and blend until they have been fully pureed. Now add the sour cream, salt, cayenne pepper, parsley, and lemon zest. You can also add a squirt of lemon juice to heighten the flavors. Blend until fully integrated and set aside.?#&amp;?#&amp;As soon as the pasta is cooked to al dente, ladle out a 1/4 cup of the pasta water into a bowl or cup. Pour the rest of the pasta water (and the pasta) into a colander and return the pasta to the pot. Toss the pasta with the reserved pasta water to help prevent excessive clumping. Serve the pasta with scallops and sauce spooned on top. If desired, garnish with a sprig of parsley and a couple wedges of lemon.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The chocolate used in this cake is fairly important. Dutch processed chocolate has a different alkalinity than unprocessed chocolate and cacao powder, so these ingredients cannot be easily interchanged in this recipe. Use a high quality eating chocolate (such as Dagoba) and pure cacao powder.?#&amp;?#&amp;Assemble the ingredients for the batter: 8 oz. (225 g) unsalted butter (softened), 1-1/4 cups (295 g) drinking water, 3/4 cup (105 g) all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup (85 g) cake flour, 1-1/2 cup (300 g) dark brown sugar, 3 large eggs, 1/4 cup (20 g) pure cacao powder, 2 oz. (55 g) 70% cacao dark chocolate, 1-1/4 tsp. baking soda, 1/4 tsp. table salt, 1/2 cup (115 g) sour cream, and 1 tsp. (5 mL) pure vanilla extract.?#&amp;?#&amp;We&#39;ll also need two 9-in. round cake pans (or 3 8-in. round cake pans for a taller three-layer cake) and two sheets of parchment paper. Place a cake pan over each sheet of parchment paper. Using a pencil, trace a circle around the base of the cake pan.?#&amp;?#&amp;Fold the parchment paper in half so that the circle forms a half circle. Then fold in half again to form a 90&#176; arc. Cut along this curve to form circles of parchment paper.?#&amp;?#&amp;The paper should fit perfectly into the bottoms of each cake pan. Using this folding and cutting technique is a bit simpler than attempting to neatly cut and entire circle.?#&amp;?#&amp;Grease the bottom and sides of each cake pan with the wrappers from the unsalted butter. (You can do this step now or after you cream the butter - whatever is convenient.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Line the bottom of each pan with the circles of parchment paper.?#&amp;?#&amp;Start by sifting the two flours, baking soda, and salt together. I like to sift them onto a sheet of wax or parchment paper because the paper can then be picked up and the contents poured out in an easy to control manner.?#&amp;?#&amp;Break up the chocolate into 1/2-inch (1 to 1.5 cm) squares and combine with the cacao powder.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring the water to a boil and measure out 1-1/4 cup. Pour over the chocolate and whisk gently until the chocolate has completely dissolved. Using water heightens the chocolate flavor of the mixture. (Try tasting chocolate melted in warm milk and compare it to the taste of chocolate melted in water. The milk based hot chocolate will feel thicker and richer, but the water based hot chocolate will have a surprisingly strong chcolate flavor.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the flour has been sifted and the chocolate melted into boiling water, cream the unsalted butter with a standing mixer equipped with a flat beater. Add the dark brown sugar and mix until butter and sugar are evenly mixed. Scrape down the bowl with a spatula.?#&amp;?#&amp;One at a time, add the eggs and beat on medium-high until fully incorporated.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Buttercream Frosting (American)?#&amp;?#&amp;Cheesecake Cupcakes?#&amp;?#&amp;Dark Chocolate Brownies?#&amp;?#&amp;Cheesecake, Plain New York Style?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Truffles?#&amp;?#&amp;Mix in sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape the bowl down.?#&amp;?#&amp;On low speed, mix in a third of the flour mixture followed by half of the chocolate liquid. Repeat with another third of the flour and the rest of the chocolate. Finally, mix in the last third of the flour. Stop the mixer once the batter has just combined.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the batter into each cake pan as evenly as possible. (For my readers who love to be as precise as possible, the fastest way to split the batter evenly is to tare the weight of a cake pan on a digital scale and alternate pouring between two pans while massing them in turn. In about thirty seconds, you can evenly split the batter with as little as 1% error.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Bake both cake pans in a 350&#176;F (175&#176;C) oven on a rack set to the center position for 25 minutes or until a toothpick or wood skewer thrust into the center of the cake and withdrawn is clean or only has dry crumbs attached.

First melt two tablespoons butter in a pan and allow the butter to foam.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place 8 oz. sliced mushrooms (button or medium cremini work well) in the butter and saute on medium heat until mushrooms give off moisture.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once most of the moisture has boiled off, add a 14 oz. can of low sodium beef broth to the pan and allow the broth to reduce.?#&amp;?#&amp;When the broth has reduced to the point where it coats the back of a spoon, add two tablespoons of heavy cream. While stirring, let the heavy cream reduce the sauce until it coats a spoon again. Remove from heat and set aside for topping the steak.?#&amp;?#&amp;Meanwhile, build a two level charcoal fire or preheat your propane grill. Prepare your Porterhouse steak by seasoning with salt and pepper on both sides. I prefer to cook thicker steaks of about 1-1/4 inch to 1-1/2 inch in thickness (a little less than 2 pounds). During grilling, the thicker steak results in a more even medium rare throughout the meat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the steak on the hottest part of the grill and leave it there for 2 minutes. If using a propane grill, close the lid. On a charcoal grill, keep the lid off, but keep an eye open for flame ups and put them out with a squirt bottle or simply move the steak to prevent charring. After two minutes, flip the steak over and brown the other side - two minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Creme Brulee (Cr&#232;me Br&#251;l&#233;e)?#&amp;?#&amp;USDA Beef Quality Grades?#&amp;?#&amp;Prime Rib or Standing Rib Roast?#&amp;?#&amp;Grilled Salmon?#&amp;?#&amp;Pan Seared Scallops with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce?#&amp;?#&amp;Once both sides have been browned, move the steak over to the lower heat and finish cooking. In general it should take about 7-8 minutes to cook to medium rare (internal temperature of 130&#176;F), but because the building of fires is different every time, I recommend using an instant read thermometer to check the internal temperature. Just insert the probe from the side of the steak and plunge the probe into the center. Don&#39;t worry if it takes longer than eight minutes, that just means your heat is too low. Continue to let it cook until the internal temperature reads 130&#176;F. Remove from grill and let the steak rest for five minutes loosely covered with aluminum foil.?#&amp;?#&amp;The filet of the Porterhouse steak should not be cooked beyond medium rare or it may toughen. I solve this by rotating the steak such that the strip steak is closer to the high heat while the tenderloin cut is on the cooler side. This will cook the filet a bit slower and not dry it out while trying to finish the top loin. Serve with mushroom topping over the steak or on the side.</Data></Cell>

This can be performed simply by lining the inside of the crust with a sheet of aluminum foil or parchment paper. Fill the foil or paper lining with pie weights (ceramic beads that keep the crust from rising and puffing up when baked empty). If you don&#39;t have pie weights handy, simply pop holes in the crust (bottom and sides) with a fork. (Make sure the crust is thawed if you&#39;re using a frozen crust.) Slip the pie crust onto the center rack and bake until the crust is light golden (about 10 minutes). In the meantime, assemble the filling.?#&amp;?#&amp;It is often faster for me to weigh out ingredients than to try to measure with liquid and dry measuring cups, so I&#39;ll list the ingredients in the units which I use in my own kitchen here and in both volume and mass below. The ingredients I use in the filling are 55 g butter, 3 large eggs (150 g total), 100 g granulated sugar, and (315 g) maple syrup. Purists will notice that I am deviating from tradition here. Normally you would use corn syrup, more sugar, and more butter. I like the flavor that maple syrup brings and I think that it&#39;s plenty sweet already.?#&amp;?#&amp;Melt the butter and whisk the ingredients together with 3 g of table salt to bring out the flavors.?#&amp;?#&amp;It takes a bit of muscle to get it smooth because of the eggs, but keep at it until it&#39;s well blended. (Or use a mixer.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Now, fold in the chopped pecans. The filling is ready now.?#&amp;?#&amp;If everything was timed correctly, the crust should be light golden yellow to brown (ten minutes). Pull it out and reduce the oven temperature to 275&#176;F. We&#39;re going to slow bake the pie to ensure the filling bakes evenly. A higher temperature might result in the center of the filling to still be liquid while the outside is overcooked.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the filling into the crust and level it. Slip it into the middle of the 275&#176;F oven and bake for 60 minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;The pie is done when you hold the sides and twist gently. The outer filling should not move and the inside should jiggle a little. Take it out and let it cool. This will allow the center to finish cooking and will let the pie set. Serve after fully cooled. I like to give it a bit of a refrigeration as well.?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Eric&#39;s Chocolate Pecan Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Cutting Boards?#&amp;?#&amp;Pumpkin Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;Dulce de Leche?#&amp;?#&amp;Traditional Chicken Pot Pie?#&amp;?#&amp;If you want to serve the pie warm, after the pie has been fully cooled, put it in an oven at 250&#176;F for 15 minutes.?#&amp;Update on July 30, 2011: After baking three of these pies in rapid succession, I have a couple more tips. I used already chopped pecan pieces (available in the bulk section of my local supermarket) to save the (sometimes messy) step of chopping the pecans. If you&#39;re lucky enough to have chopped pecans available for sale, feel free to use those. The amount of time it takes to toast them seems to vary from day to day. Just spread them out in a pan and let them toast while the oven is preheating and check on them every few minutes until they are fragrant. Then check on them more often and remove them before they begin to burn. As long as you can smell the strong aroma of toasted pecans, it&#39;s good. I store my maple syrup in the fridge, so it&#39;s cold enough to immediately turn the butter back into a solid which makes it difficult to whisk. Microwaving the maple syrup after measuring out the quantity you need until it is warm (90-100&#176;F) works well, just make sure it doesn&#39;t get too hot (150&#176;F) or the eggs could cook/curdle.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Even though the center of a truffle is traditionally ganache, truffles can be made with a variety of fillings ranging from nuts to caramel to nougat. When not made with ganache, these truffles are generally coated in a thin shell of hard chocolate. The truffles in this recipe will be made with a ganache center.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Tempering Chocolate?#&amp;?#&amp;Baguettes Deconstructed?#&amp;?#&amp;Dark Chocolate Souffle?#&amp;?#&amp;Dark Chocolate Brownies?#&amp;?#&amp;Clam Chowder, New England Style?#&amp;?#&amp;Ganache is simply a mixture of chocolate and cream. For the centers of these truffles, we&#39;ll make hard ganache - utilizing significantly more chocolate than cream. A ratio of about 2 to 1 of chocolate to cream by mass will yield a dense ganache appropriate for making truffles.?#&amp;?#&amp;Obtain 1 pound (455 g) of dark chocolate and 1 cup (235 mL) heavy whipping cream. Be sure to select a chocolate that you enjoy the flavor of.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cut the chocolate into pieces using a large serrated knife (like a sturdy bread knife). Cutting the chocolate into strips about 5 mm apart with the serrated knife will cause the chocolate to break into small pieces. Pieces of chocolate will fall all over the place, so I like to place the cutting board in a sheet pan to catch the chocolate shards.?#&amp;?#&amp;After breaking down the whole pound of chocolate, you should have a bunch of similarly sized pieces. Small, uniformly sized pieces will make melting the chocolate evenly easier. Pour all the pieces into a medium heat proof bowl.?#&amp;?#&amp;Bring the cup of heavy whipping cream just to a boil. (This is called scalding.)?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the scalded heavy cream onto the chocolate and allow it to sit for five minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir the now melted chocolate with the cream. Chocolate and small amounts of aqueous solutions (liquids containing water) do not mix well - the chocolate clumps up in what is called seizing. However, when a substantial amount of liquid is added to the chocolate, we can make chocolate syrup. A ganache is simply a syrup of chocolate and cream that does not contain enough cream to be liquid at room temperature. Once this mixture cools, it will form a hard ganache that can be molded into shapes.?#&amp;?#&amp;The melted ganache should be smooth in texture without lumps. If not all the chocolate has melted, you can heat the ganache gently over a hot pot of water. Stir until the chocolate melts and the ganache is smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;You can transfer the ganache into a smaller bowl to cool. When the ganache is solid, it may be easier for you to scoop out when working with a smaller bowl. Let the ganache cool down and chill for about an hour in the refrigerator to harden. Cold ganache is harder to scoop, but easier to form into a ball.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using a melon baller or small ice cream scoop (such as a #70), scoop out balls of hard ganache and place on a cookie sheet lined with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. As the ganache gets warmer, it will have a tendency to stick to the scooping device. You might find it easier to work with after rechilling the ganache, dipping the utensil in ice water, or simply using your hands to form rough spheres.?#&amp;?#&amp;After forming all the balls, chill the pan in the refrigerator for fifteen minutes to allow the ganache to harden back up and set into their shapes.?#&amp;?#&amp;Scoop a little cocoa powder into a small bowl. Use a pair of spoons to pick up and roll each ganache ball in the cocoa powder to coat.?#&amp;?#&amp;If you prefer a hard chocolate shell, then you&#39;ll need to melt and temper some chocolate (usually, a couple ounces will be more than enough to coat the truffles). Once the chocolate has been tempered, use a spatula to spread some onto the palm of one hand. Place the ball of ganache into the layer of chocolate and rotate, coating the ball. Place the truffle on a sheet of parchment paper or silicone baking mat or other nonstick surface for it to cool and set. Repeat the spreading of chocolate on the palm and coating for each truffle.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">First I took a large fillet of salmon and cut into pieces, each about 8 oz. (225 grams).?#&amp;?#&amp;I measured out 1/3 cup soy sauce and 1/3 cup maple syrup.?#&amp;?#&amp;After mixing the soy sauce and maple syrup together, I poured it into a 9x13 in. pan. I placed the salmon filets flesh side down into the mixture. In my case, I had more salmon than could fit in a single pan, so I whipped up another batch of soy sauce and maple syrup for the extra pieces. I slipped these into the refrigerator while preparing the glaze.?#&amp;?#&amp;I then poured 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and a 1/4 cup of maple syrup into a small saucepan. I then brought it to a simmer and held it there for a couple minutes to thicken up into a glaze. I set aside two tablespoons for use later and took the rest outside to the grill (which I turned on).?#&amp;?#&amp;I took the salmon out of the refrigerator after it had been in there for fifteen minutes and liberally covered the flesh of the fillets with fresh ground black pepper.?#&amp;?#&amp;I took the salmon out to my preheated grill. After soaking a paper towel in some vegetable oil, I used a pair of tongs and rubbed the grill with oil to keep the fish from sticking. Then, I placed the salmon flesh side down on the grill over high heat for three minutes.?#&amp;?#&amp;I flipped the salmon over (still on high heat) and brushed some glaze over each piece (onto the exposed flesh).?#&amp;?#&amp;After two minutes (when the thickest part of the filet has been cooked about halfway through), I brushed more glaze onto the flesh and flipped them over onto the low heat side of the grill.?#&amp;?#&amp;After another two minutes, the salmon is done. Brush the reserved glaze on and it&#39;s ready to serve. If cooked properly, the salmon should have a nice crust as well as a soft almost flaky interior. (If it flakes easily, then it&#39;s a bit overcooked.)?#&amp;The final judgment? Tina liked it - so it&#39;s a keeper.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">October 14, 2004 </Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">The ingredients are very similar to the Joy of Cooking recipe, but the proportions are quite different with more sugar and more peanut butter.?#&amp;?#&amp;To make about two dozen cookies, start with 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup unsalted butter. This time around I chose to use Skippy brand peanut butter. There is some concern that commercial peanut butters contain trans fatty acids since partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are used to stabilize the butter (preventing separation). On the other hand, it is common to find higher levels of aflatoxins in old fashioned peanut butter leading to a higher risk of liver cancer (if consumed regularly). According to both Skippy&#39;s nutrition FAQ and the USDA claim that there are no measurable amounts of trans fats present in commercial peanut butter. Skippy explains that the vegetable oils are almost completely fully hydrogenated (which as you remember from the Saturated Fats article cannot be trans fats since fully hydrogenated fats are chemically the same as saturated fats).?#&amp;?#&amp;Sift 1-1/4 cup all purpose flour, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, and 1/4 tsp. salt together. The remaining ingredients are 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, and 1 egg.?#&amp;?#&amp;Using a stand mixer, hand mixer, or arms of steel, mix the peanut butter and butter together until relatively smooth. Don&#39;t worry about any small lumps of butter that might persist, when we mix in the sugar, the sugar crystals will perforate the butter until it&#39;s smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Scrape the bowl down and mix both the granulated sugar and brown sugar into the butter. Mix until smooth.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the egg to the mixture and mix until integrated.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the egg has been mixed in, slowly add the flour as you stir (use the lowest setting on your mixer). I control the flow of flour by sifting the flour onto wax paper (or parchment paper) and folding it over so I can pour easily. By pouring the flour slowly, you won&#39;t overwhelm the batter and the flour will properly mix into the batter to form the final dough.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Joy of Cooking&#39;s Peanut Butter Cookies (14-in-one)?#&amp;?#&amp;Chicken &amp; Mushroom Marsala?#&amp;?#&amp;Mini Hamburgers?#&amp;?#&amp;Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;At this point, the dough should be double wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for an hour. The dough can keep in the refrigerator for a couple days or stored in the freezer for a month. I decided to make this batch immediately (without chilling). This will create a thinner, crisper cookie (because the warm dough will spread quickly).?#&amp;?#&amp;Form the dough into about two dozen 1 inch balls. I do this by picking up a lump of dough, rolling it between my hands, and finishing up by tossing the ball lightly between my hands. Place the balls of dough onto a greased or lined cookie sheet. In the pictures below, I lined the cookie sheet with aluminum foil (parchment paper works well also).?#&amp;?#&amp;Flatten each of the balls with a fork.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place one cookie sheet at a time in the center rack of an oven preheated to 375&#176;F. Bake for nine minutes and remove. Let stand on cookie sheet for one minute, then transfer to cooling racks to cool.?#&amp;?#&amp;These peanut butter cookies come out golden brown with a light crispiness that melts in your mouth.?#&amp;?#&amp;For a soft and chewy peanut butter cookie, make sure you refrigerate the dough first. Then form dough balls and press down with a fork as before. Then, simply refrigerate the uncooked cookies for at least fifteen minutes to firm it back up. Then with the oven preheated to 300&#176;F, slide one tray in at a time for a baking time of 15 minutes.?#&amp;The reason this trick works is that the butter in the dough is not as fluid when cold. Warm dough will spread out more during the first few minutes of cooking, resulting in a thinner, crispier cookie. Starting the cookie sheet and dough cold, reduces the spread, making thicker cookies. The lower oven temperature keeps the outside of the cookie from getting too crunchy before the</Data></Cell>

I prefer to use light tuna (usually made with yellowfin and skipjack tuna) for it&#39;s milder taste and softer texture than albacore.

I cover it with plastic wrap and press the wrap directly onto casserole so no film will form during refrigeration.?#&amp;?#&amp;When you&#39;re ready to serve the casserole, prepare one cup of bread crumbs.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">There are countless varieties of clam chowder - the most popular of which are called New England Style and Manhattan Style. The label New England Style has come to mean that the chowder has a cream or dairy base while Manhattan Style refers to a tomato base. A brief Google search reveals that the terms Maine style (heavy cream), Rhode Island style (light cream / soupy), Oregon style (extremely thick), Yorktown style (containing beer or ale), and Southern style (more vegetables and spices with some Worcestershire sauce) are also used - but I have yet to see them served in a restaurant. Of course, some restaurants&#39; New England Style clam chowders seem to fit the description of Oregon or Rhode Island style.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Making Butter?#&amp;?#&amp;Banana Nut Bread?#&amp;?#&amp;Bacon (Part II)?#&amp;?#&amp;Gravlax?#&amp;?#&amp;Chocolate Truffles?#&amp;?#&amp;Classic New England Style Clam Chowder begins with salt pork, but since I live in California, I&#39;ve started with the West Coast classic: bacon (this time in the form of bacon grease). But first, let&#39;s take a look at what other ingredients we&#39;ll need.?#&amp;?#&amp;Begin with one pound of diced russet potatoes (about one large potato) and 1/2 cup onion (about 1/2 medium onion). You&#39;ll also need a tablespoon of all-purpose flour and two tablespoons of bacon grease.?#&amp;?#&amp;Drain the clams from two 10-ounce cans of clams (preferably canned in water, salt water, or broth - not oil). After draining, both cans should yield about a total of 10 ounces of clam meat. Also, prepare 8 ounces of clam juice. The flavor is better if you use bottled clam juice instead of the liquid the clams are packaged in, but if clam juice is unavailable, reserve 8 ounces of the liquid from the cans.?#&amp;?#&amp;Heat two tablespoons of bacon grease and saute the onions in the hot grease until translucent, but not browned. Bacon grease can be collected and stored after you cook bacon. If you don&#39;t have any bacon grease in your refrigerator, go ahead and cook about four slices of bacon in the pan and remove the bacon and any excess bacon grease (remember to store it for future use) before sauteing the onions.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the diced potatoes and saute until all the potato has been coated by the fat. Throw in the tablespoon of flour and saute until the potatoes and onions have been coated.?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour in the cup of clam juice and bring to a boil while stirring. Once the mixture comes to a boil, reduce the heat so it just simmers with the lid on. Cook with the lid on for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a mixture of one cup whole milk and one cup heavy cream. Half-and-half will also work as long as it&#39;s on the creamier side - if not, augmentation with some heavy cream may be necessary. The amount of fat is important for the texture of the chowder. Using only milk will result in a slightly thickened (due to the potato starch) watery consistency. Using only heavy cream will result in a really smooth, but much too rich chowder. The milk and cream mixture results in a cream fat concentration around 20%, producing what I think is the perfect consistency when served hot or warm. Using combinations of milk and cream to achieve this fat ratio helps us get to our desired consistency target. For example, some light whipping cream (about 18-30% fat content) has a fat content as low as 18%, so using straight light whipping cream of this type will provide us the desired amount of fat.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the potato, onion, and clam juice mixture has simmered for 20 minutes, stir to redistribute the solids.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add the drained clams, milk, and cream.?#&amp;?#&amp;Stir and heat through until hot, but not boiling. (Boiling may cause some of the milks solids to clump - but with 20% fat concentration this is less of a problem than if we were using straight milk. At around 30% or more fat, there is enough fat to prevent the clumping of the milk solids even while boiling.) While heating, this is right time to season with salt and pepper.

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">This is the secret: brine the chicken breasts. Take four cups of cold water and add a tablespoon of table salt (add more if using kosher salt - about 1-1/2 to 2 tablespoons). Stir the water to get the salt to dissolve. Once the solution is no longer cloudy and is clear, put the chicken breasts into a large resealable plastic bag and pour the solution into the bag. Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least three hours and no more than six hours (the chicken may become too salty). Rinse the chicken after you remove it from the brine and dry with paper towels.?#&amp;?#&amp;Now rub 1/2 tsp. ground cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. ground coriander seed, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon onto both sides of each breast.?#&amp;?#&amp;Place the breasts onto a heated grill for 3 min. on each side. Adjust the grill to low (or move the breasts to the low side of a two level fire) and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160&#176;F (70&#176;C), about ten minutes (on my grill). If you don&#39;t have an instant read or meat thermometer, I recommend two alternatives. First, you can poke a hole in the breast (with a knife or fork) and see if the &quot;juices run clear&quot;. If the chicken is undercooked, the liquid that comes out will carry a pink or yellow hue. When the chicken is done, the liquid that comes out is clear as water. Alternatively, you can cut into the chicken and look at the color. The breast should be completely white. Another popular method is to press on the chicken and feel if it is done. This is a technique that takes experience and is not recommended for your first time. The chicken will feel springy, but not soft. It should also not be hard (then it&#39;s overcooked). The benefit of this technique is that the chicken is not violated with holes or cuts that can release juices that would otherwise keep the breast tender and juicy. I recommend learning the touch technique by pressing on breasts that are done so you can get a feel for how the breast should feel for future meals.?#&amp;?#&amp;I served the chicken breast with the Sauteed Okra with Roasted Red Peppers, Green Bean Casserole, and fresh corn bread.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">After experimenting with adding ground almonds to Chinese Almond Cookies and reading about grinding roasted pecans into Cook&#39;s Country&#39;s version of Pecan Coffee Cake (which I found surprising because it&#39;s a Bundt cake, which they claim is traditional - even though I&#39;ve never seen a coffee cake sold or presented in the shape of a Bundt - still, could be true...), I thought I should add some ground pecans (essentially a &quot;pecan flour&quot;) to the batter of my recipe. I had previously used the pecan streusel topping to provide the pecan punch - which, although simple, worked rather well. It probably helped that this coffee cake isn&#39;t particularly tall (thus the ratio between streusel and cake was not overwhelmingly in the favor of the cake and you were practically guaranteed streusel in every bite). However, adding the ground pecans to the batter turned a good recipe into a great recipe.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Chinese Almond Cookies?#&amp;?#&amp;Pan Pizza?#&amp;?#&amp;Simple Tiramisu?#&amp;?#&amp;Condensed Milk Fudge?#&amp;?#&amp;English Toffee?#&amp;?#&amp;Start off by toasting 1-1/4 cup (135 g) chopped pecans. Do this by spreading them out on a sheet pan and baking in the oven as it preheats, about ten minutes. (Preheat the oven to 350&#176;F or 175&#176;C.) Once the pecans are fragrant, take them out of the oven. Keeping them in the oven too long will result in slight burning which will leave an acrid flavor to everything - so avoid this at all costs.?#&amp;?#&amp;Use a spice grinder or a food processor to finely process 1/4-cup of the roasted pecans (about 25-30 g). Use a succession of quick pulses because too much processing will result in a paste. About ten pulses from my spice grinder provided adequate results. Reserve the rest of the roasted pecans for the streusel.?#&amp;?#&amp;As usual, assemble your ingredients before beginning. For the dry ingredients, use 1/4-cup (25-30 g) roasted pecans, finely ground, 1 Tbs. baking powder, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 2 cups (250 g) sifted all-purpose flour. For the &quot;wet&quot; ingredients, gather up 1 cup (225 g) butter, softened, 2 large eggs, 1 Tbs. vanilla extract, 1 cup (230 g) sour cream, and 1-1/2 (300 g) sugar. For the streusel, prepare 1/2 cup (110 g) brown sugar, 2 Tbs. butter, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1 cup (110 g) roasted pecans, chopped.?#&amp;?#&amp;Whisk the flour, baking powder, and finely processed pecans together.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cream the butter and sugar together in a mixer until smooth (about 30 seconds at medium low speed). Using softened butter, will reduce the tendency for the butter to stick to the sides of the mixing bowl (and thus reducing the need to scrape down the bowl).?#&amp;?#&amp;Scrape down the sides of the mixing bowl. Add the sour cream to the mixture and beat until combined.?#&amp;?#&amp;Scrape down the bowl again, if needed. At low speed, mix in one egg at a time. Mix in the vanilla extract.?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove the mixing bowl from the mixer and add the flour mixture to the contents. Using a spatula, fold the solids into the batter.?#&amp;?#&amp;The resulting mixture may have a few lumps. Don&#39;t worry about these - they&#39;ll cook out as you bake the cake.?#&amp;?#&amp;Prepare a 9x13-in. baking pan by greasing the bottom and sides with a little butter. To make extraction and cutting easier, I like to line the inside with a sheet of parchment paper that hangs out over the sides. The extra paper will act as handles later when I pull the cake out of the pan. Press the paper to the pan so it is as flush as possible (wrinkles in the paper will result in wrinkles in your coffee cake).?#&amp;?#&amp;Pour the batter into the baking pan and level with a spatula.?#&amp;?#&amp;For the streusel topping, melt two tablespoons butter in the microwave (about 10-15 seconds). Meanwhile, combine the remaining pecans with the brown sugar and cinnamon.?#&amp;?#&amp;If the butter hasn&#39;t completely melted, swirl the melted butter around the unmelted piece until it has completely melted. (If this doesn&#39;t work, microwave for a few more seconds.) Pour the butter into the sugar/pecan/cinnamon mix. Mix together until it becomes a unifo</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">You&#39;ll need a large pot - I used a 12 quart Multi-Pot but any large pot will work. I wouldn&#39;t try it in a pot with a capacity smaller than 8 quarts because you&#39;ll need enough room for the poultry, vegetables, and water to cover.?#&amp;?#&amp;Take the remains of a chicken or turkey after it&#39;s been carved and break it into pieces so it will fit in your pot. Alternatively, you can use the bones from chicken parts or a pack of chicken wings. To season the stock, wash and rough cut four carrots, four celery ribs, and one onion. Throw these into the stock pot with the poultry and add two peeled garlic cloves, 2 bay leaves, about fifteen whole peppercorns, two whole cloves, 1 tsp. ground thyme, and 1 tsp. ground parsley.?#&amp;?#&amp;Related Articles?#&amp;?#&amp;Classic Roast Turkey?#&amp;?#&amp;Matzo (Matzah) Ball Soup?#&amp;?#&amp;Giblet Pan Gravy?#&amp;?#&amp;Cutting Up Chicken?#&amp;?#&amp;Cream of Mushroom Soup?#&amp;?#&amp;Since I used a multi-pot, I had the luxury of placing the colander insert into the pot and then adding all the solid ingredients. This is a nice arrangement because after I&#39;m done with the stock, I can easily remove all the solids by lifting out the colander insert. The steamer basket can also be placed ontop to help keep all the solids under water.?#&amp;Pour in enough drinking water to cover the solids by at least an inch, about 2 gallons. Over high heat, bring the water to a simmer (about 190&#176;F or 88&#176;C) while being careful not to let it come to a full boil. As anyone who has watched Tampopo knows, bringing the stock to a full boil will break up the solids into particulate matter that clouds the liquid. We want to cook the stock slowly and gently. A simmer is almost as hot as a rolling boil, but the liquid is just barely bubbling. The bubbles should be forming slowly and steadily. If no bubbles form, then the water is not hot enough; but if bubbles begin to rise rapidly, the water is too hot. Once the water begins to simmer, fiddle with your heat settings until it maintains the simmer.?#&amp;?#&amp;Continue to simmer the stock for at least four hours, checking on the water level every thirty minutes or so. If the water level has dropped and solids are beginning to be exposed, boil some water separately and pour it into the stock until the water level has risen beyond the solids again.?#&amp;?#&amp;When you get tired of simmering (after four or more hours), it&#39;s time to drain the solids from the stock. Since I used a multi-pot, I just carefully lifted up the collander and tilted it to drain. If you&#39;re not using a multipot, you can pour the stock into another pot with a large collander placed over it. Make sure the other pot is large enough to hold the liquid (about two quarts) or use multiple receiving pots.?#&amp;?#&amp;To remove smaller particles in the stock, pour the liquid through a fine mesh sieve placed over a large pot. I placed my 8-quart pot in the kitchen sink on a layer of ice. This means I won&#39;t have to carry around a nearly full container filled with simmering stock.?#&amp;?#&amp;Add more ice around the pot to help chill the stock quickly. I also recommend a tip from Alton Brown: place a bottle or two of ice in the middle of the stock to chill inside out as well as outside in. To do this, simply take a water bottle and fill it 60-70% full of water and freeze. Update for 2005: For the last year, I&#39;ve been simply placing the stock pot into a sink filled with enough cold water to allow the pot to almost float (but not quite - depending on your pot shape and water level, your pot could tip over). If I&#39;ve got ice available, I&#39;ll throw that in the water to keep it cool as the slowly sucks the heat from the stock in the pot. Every ten minutes or so, I stir the stock and that works fairly well at dropping the temperature.?#&amp;?#&amp;Once the stock is chilled to around 50&#176;F (10&#176;C) (about 1-1/2 hour), move the stock to the refrigerator to finish chilling. The stock will last for about a week in the fridge. If two gallons of stock is too much for you to consume in a week (which is probably true for most fami</Data></Cell>
