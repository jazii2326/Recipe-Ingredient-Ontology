WRAP a sushi rolling mat completely with plastic wrap (which prevents the rice from sticking to the mat), then place the rice-topped nori sheet on top of the mat so that the nori is facing up. Next, arrange two halves of crab stick down the center of the nori.?&amp;#4. ARRANGE some strips of cucumber and avocado down the center of the nori also.?&amp;#5. ROLL up the sushi tightly with the sushi mat to form a neatly packed cylinder. (You can use some of your fingers to push the filling in tight as you roll.)?&amp;#6. SQUEEZE firmly to make sure the sushi roll is tightly packed.?&amp;#7. CUT each sushi roll in half using a sharp, damp knife, then place those two halves together and cut both in half, then cut each of those halves in half to make 8 pieces of sushi. Repeat the rolling process with the rest of the ingredients.?&amp;#8. SERVE the sushi with a small bowl of shoyu (soy sauce) for dipping, wasabi paste (Japanese green horseradish), and slices of gari (Japanese pickled ginger) for cleansing the palate between sushi pieces.</Data></Cell>

MIX together the fish sauce, soy sauce and sugar in a small bowl until well combined. HEAT a wok or large frying pan over high heat then add the oil. STIR-FRY the green beans and carrot for 3 minutes. ADD the garlic and curry paste and stir-fry for 1 minute. ADD the rice and stir-fry for a minute, tossing well to mix thoroughly.

Instead of shrimp, precooked chicken (leftover roast chicken is ideal) can be diced or shredded and added to the stir-fry towards the end of cooking to heat through. For extra protein and texture, a handful of peanuts or cashews make a good addition. And you can also replace the cilantro with finely chopped fresh basil, and the lime juice with lemon juice.</Data></Cell>

REMOVE the spring roll wrappers from the package and cover with a clean damp dish cloth. PLACE one wrapper on a board on diagonal with a corner pointing towards you. SPOON 1/3 cup of the filling across in a line towards the bottom corner of the wrapper. NEATLY fold the bottom corner of the wrapper over the filling. FOLD in the sides edges to enclose the filling, then roll up to form a neatly packed cylinder, and seal with a dab of water at the top tip. REPEAT with the remaining filling. HEAT 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. PLACE half the rolls in the pan and cook for 2 minutes on all four sides (8 minutes total) until the rolls are crispy and golden. REMOVE from the pan and set aside on paper towel. COOK the remaining spring rolls in the same way. TO making the dipping sauce mix together the oyster sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar and water in a small bowl until combined. ARRANGE the spring rolls on a plate with the dipping sauce to serve.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">SOAK the chickpeas overnight in plenty of cold water, covered, on the kitchen bench (the dried chickpeas will swell to around 3 cups worth of soaked chickpeas). DRAIN the chickpeas well and place in a food processor. PULSE until they form a roughly chopped mixture. ADD the onion, garlic, tomato paste, rosemary, salt and pepper and pulse more, scraping the sides occasionally, until the ingredients are well combined and the mixture holds together. TRANSFER the mixture into a bowl and stir in the spinach, then let the mixture rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. HEAT 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. FORM the mixture into 8 fritters using the palm of your hand to flatten slightly (dampen your hands first to help prevent sticking). FRY half the fritters for 5 minutes on each side until crisp and golden. REPEAT the process with the remaining olive oil and fritters.?&amp;#Serving ideas: You can serve these fritters with salad and crusty bread, or between sliced ciabatta bread with tomato, red onion, arugula (rocket), shaved Parmesan cheese and either pesto-mayo or aioli. They&#39;re also delicious stuffed in pita pickets with salad vegetables, chili sauce (like sriracha) and feta or grilled halloumi cheese, which provides a salty cheesy contrast to the spinach. The fritters taste equally as good served in regular buns with traditional burger fixings like cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup and mustard.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">PLACE the figs, cinnamon and vanilla extract in a food processor and process to a sticky paste. IN a large bowl, mix the fig paste with the chopped dates, apricots and pistachio nuts until thoroughly combined. DIVIDE the mixture in half and place each portion along the center of a sheet of baking paper in a log shape. TIGHTLY roll up each &#39;salami&#39; in the baking paper to form a neatly packed cylinder (you can also use a sushi rolling mat to make this even easier). SQUEEZE firmly to make sure each roll is tightly packed, and secure the ends by twisting them. REFRIGERATE for 2 hours before slicing into rounds.?&amp;#This is one of the recipes from our cookbook The MediterrAsian Way.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">FILL a large saucepan with water and add the juice of 1 lemon. PEEL each pear, cut off the top and bottom, then cut into quarters. REMOVE the core and add the pear quarters to the saucepan of lemon water as you go to stop them from browning. PEEL the ginger and smash it with the side of a knife blade but keep intact. DRAIN the pears, reserving 1 cup of the lemon-water for cooking. RETURN the pears to the saucepan with the cup of lemon-water plus the sugar, cinnamon stick and ginger and mix together. BRING to the boil, cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking. MIX together the mascarpone, confectioners’ sugar, and vanilla extract in a small bowl. REMOVE the pears and simmer the remaining liquid, uncovered, until it thickens into a syrup. DISCARD the ginger and cinnamon stick and serve the pears drizzled with the syrup and topped with the sweet mascarpone.</Data></Cell>
