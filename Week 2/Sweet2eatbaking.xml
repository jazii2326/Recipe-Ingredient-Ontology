Using a thermometer, cook until the mixture reaches 170&#176;F/77&#176;C.?#&amp;Remove the curd from the heat and transfer into a bowl. Press plastic wrap in the surface of the lime curd to keep a skin from forming. Chill the lime curd in a refrigerator, the curd will thicken more as it cools.

Beat in eggs on low speed until blended then beat in the sour cream, vanilla and plain/all purpose flour until just blended. Remove 1 cup of batter and reserve.?#&amp;Pour the remaining batter over the crust.?#&amp;Mix a &#189; cup of the tinted lime curd with 1 cup of the reserved batter. Place spoonfuls or dollops of this mixture, in no particular fashion, on top of the plain cheesecake batter. Repeat with the remaining &#188; cup lime curd onto the previous mixture. Using a skewer or toothpick, swirl the mixture together to create a marbled effect.?#&amp;Bake for 35 minutes at 325&#176;F/170&#176;C. Allow to cool completely in the pan then refrigerate.?#&amp;Once chilled, lift the cheesecake out of the pan with the parchment overhang and cut into bars before serving.</Data></Cell>

Keep kneading until the paste colour is even. Don&#39;t worry if it looks like a very dark grey at this point, the colour deepens more over a period of time.?#&amp;Once you have coloured the sugarpaste, add a pinch of tylo (cmc) powder or gum tragacanth and knead well.?#&amp;Immediately roll out the black sugarpaste quite thinly, but not too thin it becomes unworkable, then using the mini number cutouts, cutout the year ensuring you cutout a few sets extra in case of breakages.?#&amp;?#&amp;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;NYE cupcakes tutorial&quot; src=&quot;../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NYE-tut-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NYE cupcakes tutorial&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, break off around half of the remaining white sugarpaste and again add around 2 large pinches of tylo powder and knead well. Immediately roll out and using a 58/60mm circle or scalloped cutter, cut as many circles as needed for the cupcakes you will be topping. Allow both the year and the circle cutouts to dry thoroughly, preferably overnight, before moving on to the next step.?#&amp;?#&amp;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;NYE tut 2&quot; src=&quot;../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NYE-tut-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NYE tut 2&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;?#&amp;?#&amp;Once your sugarpaste decorations are thoroughly dry, using a little water, attach the year onto your circles, and if desired, paint a very small amount of water onto your year decorations by either using a new unused paintbrush, or using a piece of damp kitchen paper and dab on.

Once dry, shake the excess glitter off onto a piece of paper and funnel back in to the glitter container.?#&amp;For the clock decorations, use the provided double-ended edible ink pen and draw on your clock face.

Remove the salted caramel from the freezer and scoop out the salted caramel with a teaspoon and push into the pudding mixture, ensuring the caramels are encased in the pudding mixture.?#&amp;Bake for 12 minutes, or until the sides look baked but the middle is still a little wobbly. Remove from the oven and leave the puddings in their moulds for 3 minutes, then carefully slide a small palette knife around the inside edges of the moulds carefully turning them out onto serving plates.

If using a large cake tin, increase baking time accordingly.?#&amp;Once baked, allow the cakes to cool in their tin for 5 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack upside down and allow to cool completely. Once cool, wrap each cake in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for 1-3+ hours (15-25 mins in the freezer) until the sponge has firmed up.?#&amp;Once firm, using a serrated knife trim any mounds from the tops of the cupcakes (this will be the bottom) then cut the cakes in half. Like making a sandwich, use a teaspoon and spread some of the conserve or jam onto both halves of the cakes. Pipe or spread whipped cream onto one half of the cake and use the other half to sandwich together. Repeat on all of the remaining cakes.?#&amp;For decoration (optional), dust a little icing (confectioners’) sugar onto the top of the mini cakes.</Data></Cell>

Mould your roses *see notes* and place one of each onto 8 cupcakes.?#&amp;To make the vampire bites, Add a very small amount of black food colouring to the raspberry conserve to deepen the colour to a blood shade and using the end of a chopstick or a wooden skewer, indent the frosting of the 4 remaining cakes and pour in a small amount of raspberry jam, allowing it to ooze over the frosting a little.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Crust?#&amp;?#&amp;2 cups graham crackers or digestive biscuits, crushed?#&amp;1 stick (113g) butter, melted?#&amp;?#&amp;Lime Curd?#&amp;?#&amp;1 stick (113g) butter, softened?#&amp;1 cup granulated sugar?#&amp;2 large eggs?#&amp;2 large egg yolks?#&amp;⅓ cup + 4 tbsp fresh lime juice?#&amp;?#&amp;Cheesecake Filling?#&amp;?#&amp;2 8oz packs cream cheese, softened?#&amp;&#189; cup granulated sugar?#&amp;2 large eggs?#&amp;1 large egg white?#&amp;2 tbsp plain/all purpose flour?#&amp;&#189; cup sour cream?#&amp;1 tsp vanilla extract?#&amp;green and yellow food colouring (liquid or gel)</Data></Cell>
<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To make the Lime Curd – Beat butter and sugar into a large bowl. Slowly add the eggs and the yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Pour in the lime juice and mix again. Expect the mixture to look curdled, this is normal.?#&amp;Cook the mixture over medium heat in a medium-sized saucepan until it looks smooth and no longer curdled. Increase the heat slightly and cook, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens. Using a thermometer, cook until the mixture reaches 170&#176;F/77&#176;C.?#&amp;Remove the curd from the heat and transfer into a bowl. Press plastic wrap in the surface of the lime curd to keep a skin from forming. Chill the lime curd in a refrigerator, the curd will thicken more as it cools. It will keep in the fridge for approx. 2 weeks.?#&amp;To make the crust – Preheat the oven to 325&#176;F/175&#176;C, line a 10&#215;10 inch square pan with parchment that overhangs the edges.?#&amp;Mix the butter and graham crackers (digestive biscuits) together and press into the bottom of the pan evenly.?#&amp;Bake the crust for 5 minutes and allow to cool completely.?#&amp;To make the filling – Tint &#190; of a cup of the premade lime curd with the green and yellow food colouring until a lime-rind green and set aside.?#&amp;Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with mixer on medium-high speed until smooth. Beat in eggs on low speed until blended then beat in the sour cream, vanilla and plain/all purpose flour until just blended. Remove 1 cup of batter and reserve.?#&amp;Pour the remaining batter over the crust.?#&amp;Mix a &#189; cup of the tinted lime curd with 1 cup of the reserved batter. Place spoonfuls or dollops of this mixture, in no particular fashion, on top of the plain cheesecake batter. Repeat with the remaining &#188; cup lime curd onto the previous mixture. Using a skewer or toothpick, swirl the mixture together to create a marbled effect.?#&amp;Bake for 35 minutes at 325&#176;F/170&#176;C. Allow to cool completely in the pan then refrigerate.?#&amp;Once chilled, lift the cheesecake out of the pan with the parchment overhang and cut into bars before serving.</Data></Cell>

Meanwhile, sift the flour and baking powder into a separate bowl and set aside.

Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, until risen and firm to the touch.?#&amp;Meanwhile, place the granulated sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool for 15 minutes. Prick the tops of the warm cupcakes all over with a skewer and liberally brush with the warm lemon syrup. Transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool.?#&amp;To make the buttercream frosting, place the butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer for 2-3 minutes, until pale and creamy. Beat in the cream, then gradually sift in the icing/powdered/confectioners’ sugar and continue to beat for 2-3 minutes, until the buttercream frosting is light and fluffy. Beat in a little pink food colouring to give a pale pink colour.?#&amp;Using a small palette knife, thickly swirl the buttercream frosting over the tops of the cupcakes. Scatter sugar sprinkles or pink, white, and red ‘hundreds and thousands’ (tiny coloured sugar balls) onto a plate and roll the cupcakes’ edges in the sprinkles. Cut the straws to 8cm/3&#188; inch lengths and push into the cupcakes to decorate.</Data></Cell>

Mix in sugar to dissolve and then add in lemon juice and solid berries.

If it looks a little brown do not worry. When it comes to room temperature, transfer to the refrigerator, where it will completely firm up. Chill at least 3-4 hours.?#&amp;Frost cake carefully with buttercream on sides and top. Refrigerate for 2 hours more.?#&amp;Make ganache and spoon on top, spreading it slightly to allow it to drip on the sides. Decorate with vanilla whipped cream as desired.?#&amp;Transfer to a serving plate and slice with a thin knife run under hot water and dried between slices. Serve generous pieces.?#&amp;Place the chocolate in a small bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and let stand 1-2 minutes. Whisk until smooth.?#&amp;Cream butter for a few minutes on medium speed until soft and fluffy.?#&amp;Add in sifted icing mixture and cocoa powder, scrape butter down into the middle of the bowl and beat on low speed so the dry ingredients do not go flying out. Beat until sugar and cocoa are absorbed by the butter.?#&amp;Put mixer back on medium speed and add vanilla essence and cream, beating for 2 minutes more.?#&amp;If you want to have a stiffer frosting, add more sugar. If you want a thinner frosting, add more cream or full cream milk.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To make the honeycomb toffee, lightly oil a 8-inch square tin and set aside.?#&amp;In a heavy-based saucepan, add the sugar, vinegar and golden syrup, and heat the mixture gently, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves, then allow the mixture to come to a boil.?#&amp;Clip a sugar thermometer onto the saucepan, then continue to boil the syrup, with no further stirring, until the temperate reaches the soft crack stage at 132&#176;C to 143&#176;C (270&#176;F to 289&#176;F). Immediately remove the pan from the heat and stir in the baking soda. The mixture will bubble up, but continue stirring a little until the bubbles have subsided a little.?#&amp;Working quickly, pour the toffee mixture into the prepared tin — don’t worry about spreading the mixture into the corners, this is not needed. Leave to set until completely cold and hard, then turn out the toffee into a large bowl and break into pieces with the end of a rolling pin, until it reaches the consistency of breadbrumbs. Set aside.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat cones, either temper the dark chocolate or use a compound chocolate (chocolate chips work well). Using a small flat clean paintbrush, paint a thin layer of chocolate over the insides of the mould, ensuring to coat the indents and coating completely, then place in the fridge to set up. Repeat again if necessary.?#&amp;Meanwhile, measure 50g of the previously crushed honeycomb toffee in a small bowl and add the remaining melted chocolate. If the chocolate has started to set, just pop it in the microwave in bursts of 5-10 seconds until it is fluid again. Stir the chocolate in to the crushed honeycomb until fully coated and allow to cool for a few minutes until it&#39;s not hot but not set. If it&#39;s too warm, it will melt the outer coating of chocolate on the moulds.?#&amp;Spoon the chocolate honeycomb mixture into the indents of the mould using a teaspoon. Press the filling down in to the moulds and flatten the tops with the back of your spoon, then allow the Witches’ hat moulds to set in a cool dry place until the filling has set. Once set, turn out the chocolates by flipping the mould out and gently easing out. They should come out easily. If not, just give the tops a gentle tap. Set aside.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat rims, mark 12 circles using a plain round cookie cutter, or a glass slightly bigger than your witches’ hat moulds onto a piece of parchment or alternatively, use a macaron mould. Melt or temper the chocolate as before. Flip the parchment pencil side down on to a baking sheet and drop teaspoons of the melted chocolate onto the parchment paper using the marked circles as guidelines. Allow the chocolate to spread, using your teaspoon to help, if necessary.?#&amp;Repeat with the remaining circles then immediately place a chocolate honeycomb cone in the centre of each chocolate puddle. Allow to set completely.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat ribbons, unravel two liquorice Catherine wheels and cut them into 12 lengths of 9cm, using scissors or a sharp knife.?#&amp;If using fondant, knead until pliable and tint red with gel food colouring. Roll into a sausage and cut into 12 pea-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and cover with plastic wrap to stop them drying out too quickly.?#&amp;Wrap a liquorice strap around each hat, securing together by pressing the red fondant ball over them, then flattening the ball a little. If using M&amp;Ms, see notes on how to attach. Repeat with the remaining hats.?#&amp;Store in a single layer in an airtight container lined with parchment paper at room temperate.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To make the Lime Curd – Beat butter and sugar into a large bowl. Slowly add the eggs and the yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Pour in the lime juice and mix again. Expect the mixture to look curdled, this is normal.?#&amp;Cook the mixture over medium heat in a medium-sized saucepan until it looks smooth and no longer curdled. Increase the heat slightly and cook, whisking constantly until the mixture thickens. Using a thermometer, cook until the mixture reaches 170&#176;F/77&#176;C.?#&amp;Remove the curd from the heat and transfer into a bowl. Press plastic wrap in the surface of the lime curd to keep a skin from forming. Chill the lime curd in a refrigerator, the curd will thicken more as it cools. It will keep in the fridge for approx. 2 weeks.?#&amp;To make the crust – Preheat the oven to 325&#176;F/175&#176;C, line a 10&#215;10 inch square pan with parchment that overhangs the edges.?#&amp;Mix the butter and graham crackers (digestive biscuits) together and press into the bottom of the pan evenly.?#&amp;Bake the crust for 5 minutes and allow to cool completely.?#&amp;To make the filling – Tint &#190; of a cup of the premade lime curd with the green and yellow food colouring until a lime-rind green and set aside.?#&amp;Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with mixer on medium-high speed until smooth. Beat in eggs on low speed until blended then beat in the sour cream, vanilla and plain/all purpose flour until just blended. Remove 1 cup of batter and reserve.?#&amp;Pour the remaining batter over the crust.?#&amp;Mix a &#189; cup of the tinted lime curd with 1 cup of the reserved batter. Place spoonfuls or dollops of this mixture, in no particular fashion, on top of the plain cheesecake batter. Repeat with the remaining &#188; cup lime curd onto the previous mixture. Using a skewer or toothpick, swirl the mixture together to create a marbled effect.?#&amp;Bake for 35 minutes at 325&#176;F/170&#176;C. Allow to cool completely in the pan then refrigerate.?#&amp;Once chilled, lift the cheesecake out of the pan with the parchment overhang and cut into bars before serving.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To make the crust – Start by turning the biscuits into fine crumbs, either using a food processor or by putting them in a plastic bag and crushing them with a rolling pin, and add the dry coriander (cilantro).?#&amp;Melt the butter and add to the biscuit mixture. Combine well and then tip it into a 9” spring-form cake tin. Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture down to form an evenly packed base.?#&amp;Transfer to the fridge to set.?#&amp;To make the filling – In a blender puree the flesh of 2 mangos. Put half in the fridge for later – you’ll use this for your topping.?#&amp;Dissolve the gelatin in about a third of a mug of warm water and leave to cool.?#&amp;Very finely chop the ginger and fresh coriander and set aside.?#&amp;In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese, sugar and icing sugar using a spoon to mix vigorously. Then stir in the mango puree and gelatin.?#&amp;In a separate bowl, whip the cream until soft peaks form. Stir this in gently to the cream cheese mixture. Gently fold in the ginger and fresh coriander (cilantro) until evenly mixed in.?#&amp;Pour the mixture into the tin on top of the biscuit base and transfer to the fridge. Allow to chill for at least 2 hours before adding the topping.?#&amp;To make the topping – Add the juice of one lime to the remaining mango puree.?#&amp;Dissolve 1 tsp gelatin in about 3 tbsp warm water and add to the mango mixture, stirring well. Pour the topping over the top spread it out evenly using a spoon.?#&amp;Return the cake to the fridge. Leave it to chill for at least another 3 hours – but ideally overnight.?#&amp;Carefully remove from the tin and transfer to a plate or cake stand.?#&amp;Served best after a delicious Asian feast!</Data></Cell>

Mix in sugar to dissolve and then add in lemon juice and solid berries. Let cool slightly before placing in a blender and pureeing till smooth.?#&amp;Prepare Almond Cookie Crust: Preheat oven to 204℃/400℉/Gas Mark 6. Place cookies, almonds, sugar and salt in a food processor and process till finely ground.?#&amp;Add in butter and process again till mixture is combined. Transfer mixture to a greased (do not line, that was my mistake) 20cm (8in) springform tin and press in to make a thick base. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. Set aside to cool. Once semi-warm, refrigerate till needed.?#&amp;Reduce oven temperature to 170℃/320℉/Gas Mark 3. Combine cream cheese and sugar using an electric beater till smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time until completely combined. Beat in essence and salt. Blend in sour cream until well incorporated. Beat in puree.?#&amp;Place a large water bath dish on a rack a little lower than where the cheesecake will go in the oven, filled with boiling water. Place the other rack in the middle of the oven and place cheesecake on top. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, or until jiggles only slightly in the middle, making sure to turn the temperature down to 150℃/300℉/Gas Mark 2 for approximately 30 minutes.?#&amp;Let cool in the oven with the door open halfway for 20 minutes before letting rest on a wire rack till room temperature. If it looks a little brown do not worry. When it comes to room temperature, transfer to the refrigerator, where it will completely firm up. Chill at least 3-4 hours.?#&amp;Frost cake carefully with buttercream on sides and top. Refrigerate for 2 hours more.?#&amp;Make ganache and spoon on top, spreading it slightly to allow it to drip on the sides. Decorate with vanilla whipped cream as desired.?#&amp;Transfer to a serving plate and slice with a thin knife run under hot water and dried between slices. Serve generous pieces.?#&amp;Place the chocolate in a small bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and let stand 1-2 minutes. Whisk until smooth.?#&amp;Cream butter for a few minutes on medium speed until soft and fluffy.?#&amp;Add in sifted icing mixture and cocoa powder, scrape butter down into the middle of the bowl and beat on low speed so the dry ingredients do not go flying out. Beat until sugar and cocoa are absorbed by the butter.?#&amp;Put mixer back on medium speed and add vanilla essence and cream, beating for 2 minutes more.?#&amp;If you want to have a stiffer frosting, add more sugar. If you want a thinner frosting, add more cream or full cream milk.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To make the honeycomb toffee, lightly oil a 8-inch square tin and set aside.?#&amp;In a heavy-based saucepan, add the sugar, vinegar and golden syrup, and heat the mixture gently, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves, then allow the mixture to come to a boil.?#&amp;Clip a sugar thermometer onto the saucepan, then continue to boil the syrup, with no further stirring, until the temperate reaches the soft crack stage at 132&#176;C to 143&#176;C (270&#176;F to 289&#176;F). Immediately remove the pan from the heat and stir in the baking soda. The mixture will bubble up, but continue stirring a little until the bubbles have subsided a little.?#&amp;Working quickly, pour the toffee mixture into the prepared tin — don’t worry about spreading the mixture into the corners, this is not needed. Leave to set until completely cold and hard, then turn out the toffee into a large bowl and break into pieces with the end of a rolling pin, until it reaches the consistency of breadbrumbs. Set aside.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat cones, either temper the dark chocolate or use a compound chocolate (chocolate chips work well). Using a small flat clean paintbrush, paint a thin layer of chocolate over the insides of the mould, ensuring to coat the indents and coating completely, then place in the fridge to set up. Repeat again if necessary.?#&amp;Meanwhile, measure 50g of the previously crushed honeycomb toffee in a small bowl and add the remaining melted chocolate. If the chocolate has started to set, just pop it in the microwave in bursts of 5-10 seconds until it is fluid again. Stir the chocolate in to the crushed honeycomb until fully coated and allow to cool for a few minutes until it&#39;s not hot but not set. If it&#39;s too warm, it will melt the outer coating of chocolate on the moulds.?#&amp;Spoon the chocolate honeycomb mixture into the indents of the mould using a teaspoon. Press the filling down in to the moulds and flatten the tops with the back of your spoon, then allow the Witches’ hat moulds to set in a cool dry place until the filling has set. Once set, turn out the chocolates by flipping the mould out and gently easing out. They should come out easily. If not, just give the tops a gentle tap. Set aside.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat rims, mark 12 circles using a plain round cookie cutter, or a glass slightly bigger than your witches’ hat moulds onto a piece of parchment or alternatively, use a macaron mould. Melt or temper the chocolate as before. Flip the parchment pencil side down on to a baking sheet and drop teaspoons of the melted chocolate onto the parchment paper using the marked circles as guidelines. Allow the chocolate to spread, using your teaspoon to help, if necessary.?#&amp;Repeat with the remaining circles then immediately place a chocolate honeycomb cone in the centre of each chocolate puddle. Allow to set completely.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat ribbons, unravel two liquorice Catherine wheels and cut them into 12 lengths of 9cm, using scissors or a sharp knife.?#&amp;If using fondant, knead until pliable and tint red with gel food colouring. Roll into a sausage and cut into 12 pea-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and cover with plastic wrap to stop them drying out too quickly.?#&amp;Wrap a liquorice strap around each hat, securing together by pressing the red fondant ball over them, then flattening the ball a little. If using M&amp;Ms, see notes on how to attach. Repeat with the remaining hats.?#&amp;Store in a single layer in an airtight container lined with parchment paper at room temperate.</Data></Cell>

Remove the salted caramel from the freezer and scoop out the salted caramel with a teaspoon and push into the pudding mixture, ensuring the caramels are encased in the pudding mixture.?#&amp;Bake for 12 minutes, or until the sides look baked but the middle is still a little wobbly. Remove from the oven and leave the puddings in their moulds for 3 minutes, then carefully slide a small palette knife around the inside edges of the moulds carefully turning them out onto serving plates.

Secure to the cake using cooled boiled water, then secure the other features, such as the eyes, eyebrows, nose, ears and mouth.?#&amp;For the ears, roll a large ball of milk chocolate fondant and shape into a semi-circle, hollowing out the middle and moulding a larger lip at the top.

Cut dough in 3-inch squares, then transfer to a baking sheet lined with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Use a toothpick or cake tester to pole an even pattern of holes onto each cookie’s surface (optional). Repeat rolling and cutting of dough using the scraps if necessary to create 18 cookies, then place the cookie sheets in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. Remove and bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the tops are matte and cookies are just set. Do not over bake.?#&amp;Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, refrigerate or freeze the cookies until ready to use.?#&amp;To assemble the sandwiches, using the foil or parchment paper, carefully lift the block of cookie dough ice cream from the baking pan and place on a cutting board. Using a large knife, cut ice cream into 9 equal squares. Place 1 piece of ice cream between 2 chilled cookies and press lightly to adhere. Freeze the sandwiches until ready to use.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Preheat the oven to 160&#176;C, 325&#176;F, Gas Mark 3. Grease and line two baking trays (alternatively, use baking/parchment paper, silicone liners or Silpat or similar).?#&amp;Beat together the butter and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until creamy.?#&amp;Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and add one half of it to the butter mixture and beat until combined. Add the rest of the flour and mix to a dough.?#&amp;Roll the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film (plastic wrap) and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.?#&amp;Lightly flour your work surface and roll out the dough to 3-4mm thick. Using your desired cutter(s), cut out shapes and place on your prepared baking trays. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes on the trays before moving to a cooling rack.?#&amp;While the cookies are cooling, use this time to whip up a batch of royal icing. First, sift the icing sugar (confectioners/powdered sugar) into a large bowl then slowly add the egg whites and thoroughly mix the two together.?#&amp;Keep mixing until the icing is glossy and is the correct consistency. To test: run a knife through the middle of the icing approx. 1″ deep. If the icing forms a flat surface between 5-10 seconds, it is the correct consistency. Some people prefer a thicker consistency for outlining and allow for a flat surface between 15-20 seconds.?#&amp;Transfer the icing into separate bowls – as many as you have colours. Apply a few drops of gel or paste food colouring until you reach your desired shade.?#&amp;If you prefer two different consistencies, divide icing into two – one for outlining (15-20 second icing), and one for flooding (10 second icing) to ensure both are the same shade.?#&amp;Decorate as desired. Leave to set overnight. I tend to find that my icing takes longer to dry as I work in humid conditions. My royal icing takes 24-48 hours to set completely.</Data></Cell>

Then gradually add in the sugar, a little at a time, until all the sugar has been incorporated or until desired consistency.?#&amp;Add a few drops of food colouring and thoroughly beat in. If necessary, add in more food colouring until you get the perfect leaf green colour then beat in 1-2 tablespoons of single cream or milk.?#&amp;Spoon the frosting into a piping bag fitted with the grass/hair piping tip, and hold the piping bag in a vertical position with the tip almost touching the cupcake. Squeeze the piping bag in this position lifting up as you pipe and release the pressure when you have grass like strands. Repeat this process to cover the cupcake hiding any gaps near the edge.?#&amp;To decorate, immediately after frosting and working cupcake by cupcake so that the frosting doesn&#39;t set, place one of the bunny decorations on each cupcake gently pressing into the frosting. As the frosting dries, it will act like glue and secure the bunny in place.</Data></Cell>

Keep kneading until the paste colour is even. Don&#39;t worry if it looks like a very dark grey at this point, the colour deepens more over a period of time.?#&amp;Once you have coloured the sugarpaste, add a pinch of tylo (cmc) powder or gum tragacanth and knead well.?#&amp;Immediately roll out the black sugarpaste quite thinly, but not too thin it becomes unworkable, then using the mini number cutouts, cutout the year ensuring you cutout a few sets extra in case of breakages.?#&amp;?#&amp;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;NYE cupcakes tutorial&quot; src=&quot;../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NYE-tut-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NYE cupcakes tutorial&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, break off around half of the remaining white sugarpaste and again add around 2 large pinches of tylo powder and knead well. Immediately roll out and using a 58/60mm circle or scalloped cutter, cut as many circles as needed for the cupcakes you will be topping. Allow both the year and the circle cutouts to dry thoroughly, preferably overnight, before moving on to the next step.?#&amp;?#&amp;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;NYE tut 2&quot; src=&quot;../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NYE-tut-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NYE tut 2&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;?#&amp;?#&amp;Once your sugarpaste decorations are thoroughly dry, using a little water, attach the year onto your circles, and if desired, paint a very small amount of water onto your year decorations by either using a new unused paintbrush, or using a piece of damp kitchen paper and dab on. Then sprinkle some of the edible glitter on top. Once dry, shake the excess glitter off onto a piece of paper and funnel back in to the glitter container.?#&amp;For the clock decorations, use the provided double-ended edible ink pen and draw on your clock face.

Then with an electric whisk (don’t even try with a hand whisk – eeps!) whisk for approx. 7-10 minutes, or until the icing has increased in volume, is thick and shiny and forms soft peaks. Working quickly (this frosting sets fast!), spread over the cupcakes, swirling with a small palette or kitchen knife.?#&amp;To make the roses, divide the white fondant in half and colour half a blood red colour using a claret and Christmas red gel food colouring. Colour the remaining half black. Alternatively, you can buy the fondant already coloured from your local cake decorating store, if you don&#39;t fancy colouring yourself. Mould your roses *see notes* and place one of each onto 8 cupcakes.?#&amp;To make the vampire bites, Add a very small amount of black food colouring to the raspberry conserve to deepen the colour to a blood shade and using the end of a chopstick or a wooden skewer, indent the frosting of the 4 remaining cakes and pour in a small amount of raspberry jam, allowing it to ooze over the frosting a little.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Preheat the oven to 200&#186;C, fan 180&#186;C, 350℉ gas mark 6. Place the butter in a medium sized saucepan. Add 150ml cold water and simmer over a low heat until the butter has melted. Bring to the boil, then quickly add the flour and sugar (I sifted both the flour and sugar into a different bowl then bunged them both in together straight off the heat). Remove from the heat (or do it my way) and beat briskly with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms a smooth ball that leaves the sides of the saucepan clean.?#&amp;Tip into a bowl and leave to cool for 5 minutes, then gradually add the egg, beating until you have a smooth, shiny paste (I put my mixture into my mixer, attached a K-beater and added all of the eggs at once then turned on high until sufficient smooth, shiny paste as mentioned above). Lightly grease a sheet of baking paper and place on a baking tray (I greased the tray and placed a clean sheet of baking paper on top of greased tray). Spoon the paste into a piping bag with a plain nozzle and pipe into 18 walnut-sized balls, leaving space between them for spreading.?#&amp;Bake for 10 minutes, then increase the oven tempreature to 220&#186;C, fan 200&#186;C, gas 7 and bake for a further 15 minutes, until the choux buns are light golden brown and firm to the touch (here, I adjusted cooking times as mine were cooked with 5 minutes remaining on the clock, so best to keep an eye on them during the last 15 minutes of cooking). Quickly pierce each one underneath with a skewer to let steam escape, then leave to cool on a wire rack (I left mine on the baking tray on the baking paper covered after and they were absolutely fine and not at all greasy underneath).?#&amp;To make the sauce, place a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water and melt the chocolate with the double cream and golden syrup until smooth (I melted the chocolate completely first before adding the double cream and golden syrup).?#&amp;To make the filling, whip the cream with the icing sugar. When the profiteroles are cold, pipe the cream into the middle of each and spread (or in my case drizzle (yum)) the tops with chocolate sauce.</Data></Cell>

If you don&#39;t have a milk foamer, you can either use a hand or electric whisk, or add the milk powder and water into a large mason jar and shake constantly for 30-seconds to 1-minute.?#&amp;Pour the foamed milk into an extra large mug or equally between two standard mugs. You will have a little foam in the jug afterwards. Reserve the foam until later.?#&amp;In the jug with 100ml (3.5 fl oz) water, add the instant coffee and sugar (optional), and stir well to dissolve.

The dough should be soft and pliable but no sticky; if necessary, add more water until dough comes together.?#&amp;Preheat oven to 180&#176;C (350&#176;F). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into an even &#188;-inch thickness. Cut dough in 3-inch squares, then transfer to a baking sheet lined with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Use a toothpick or cake tester to pole an even pattern of holes onto each cookie’s surface (optional). Repeat rolling and cutting of dough using the scraps if necessary to create 18 cookies, then place the cookie sheets in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. Remove and bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the tops are matte and cookies are just set. Do not over bake.?#&amp;Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, refrigerate or freeze the cookies until ready to use.?#&amp;To assemble the sandwiches, using the foil or parchment paper, carefully lift the block of cookie dough ice cream from the baking pan and place on a cutting board. Using a large knife, cut ice cream into 9 equal squares. Place 1 piece of ice cream between 2 chilled cookies and press lightly to adhere. Freeze the sandwiches until ready to use.</Data></Cell>

Stir for about a minute more then transfer to a refrigerator-proof bowl, set aside to cool to room temperature, stirring every now and then to prevent a skin from forming or alternatively push plastic wrap on top of the mixture.?#&amp;Once room temperature (the mixture should be like a very thick cream in consistency at this point), cover and put in the fridge for approx. 2 hours.?#&amp;Remove from the fridge and pour into your ice cream maker, following manufacturers instructions.?#&amp;When finished churning, carefully but quickly stir in the sprinkles. Too much stirring will cause the sprinkles to leak their colour causing a muddy colour!?#&amp;Serve immediately or transfer to a freezer safe airtight container for later.?#&amp;Serve with a sprinkle of rainbow nonpareils sprinkles, optional.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To make the crepes, sift the flour, cake mix, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the eggs,&#160;melted butter, and vanilla extract. Whisk in the centre, incorporating a little flour from the sides, repeating until the mixture starts to thicken to a loose cake batter consistency, then add in&#160;the milk in thirds, repeating until a lump-free batter forms. Alternatively, place all the cr&#234;pe ingredients in the blender, and pulse until a lump-free batter forms. Allow the batter to rest in the fridge for 30-minutes to 1 hour.?#&amp;When the batter is almost ready, start to preheat a cr&#234;pe pan over a medium heat for around 5 minutes, rotating occasionally until an even heat that when water is splashed, it dances around the pan. You&#39;re aiming for a medium preheated pan, not too hot.?#&amp;Brush the pan with oil, butter, or cooking spray. Give the batter a quick stir and ladle around a &#188; cup amount of batter in the pan, tilting the pan until coated evenly with batter. Cook for around 1 minute on the first side. Flip the cr&#234;pe over and cook on the other side for 30-40 seconds, then put the cooked cr&#234;pe on a plate covered with a paper towel. Oil the pan again and repeat with remaining batter and stack with paper towels in-between each cr&#234;pe.?#&amp;Allow to cool completely.?#&amp;To make the buttercream frosting, beat the butter until light and fluffy. Beat in the cake mix and vanilla, then add the icing (confectioner&#39;s) sugar, a bit at a time until a spreadable consistency is reached. Add in the milk, as needed.?#&amp;To assemble, once the pancakes have cooled completely, spoon or pipe a line of frosting in the middle of each cr&#234;pe (left to right), then roll up the cr&#234;pes.?#&amp;If desired, add some sprinkles to the buttercream frosting showing at the opening of the cr&#234;pes.?#&amp;Serve immediately.</Data></Cell>

Then gradually add in the sugar, a little at a time, until all the sugar has been incorporated or until desired consistency.?#&amp;Add a few drops of food colouring and thoroughly beat in. If necessary, add in more food colouring until you get the perfect leaf green colour then beat in 1-2 tablespoons of single cream or milk.?#&amp;Spoon the frosting into a piping bag fitted with the grass/hair piping tip, and hold the piping bag in a vertical position with the tip almost touching the cupcake. Squeeze the piping bag in this position lifting up as you pipe and release the pressure when you have grass like strands. Repeat this process to cover the cupcake hiding any gaps near the edge.?#&amp;To decorate, immediately after frosting and working cupcake by cupcake so that the frosting doesn&#39;t set, place one of the bunny decorations on each cupcake gently pressing into the frosting. As the frosting dries, it will act like glue and secure the bunny in place.</Data></Cell>

Don&#39;t worry if it looks like a very dark grey at this point, the colour deepens more over a period of time.?#&amp;Once you have coloured the sugarpaste, add a pinch of tylo (cmc) powder or gum tragacanth and knead well.?#&amp;Immediately roll out the black sugarpaste quite thinly, but not too thin it becomes unworkable, then using the mini number cutouts, cutout the year ensuring you cutout a few sets extra in case of breakages.?#&amp;?#&amp;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;NYE cupcakes tutorial&quot; src=&quot;../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NYE-tut-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NYE cupcakes tutorial&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;?#&amp;?#&amp;Next, break off around half of the remaining white sugarpaste and again add around 2 large pinches of tylo powder and knead well. Immediately roll out and using a 58/60mm circle or scalloped cutter, cut as many circles as needed for the cupcakes you will be topping. Allow both the year and the circle cutouts to dry thoroughly, preferably overnight, before moving on to the next step.?#&amp;?#&amp;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;NYE tut 2&quot; src=&quot;../wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NYE-tut-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NYE tut 2&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; height=&quot;275&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;?#&amp;?#&amp;Once your sugarpaste decorations are thoroughly dry, using a little water, attach the year onto your circles, and if desired, paint a very small amount of water onto your year decorations by either using a new unused paintbrush, or using a piece of damp kitchen paper and dab on.

Once dry, shake the excess glitter off onto a piece of paper and funnel back in to the glitter container.?#&amp;For the clock decorations, use the provided double-ended edible ink pen and draw on your clock face.

Check at 1 minute, and 1 minute 15 seconds. The cake should be moist so if testing with a toothpick, some crumbs may&#160;cling.?#&amp;Remove from the microwave and allow to cool fully before frosting. You can speed this up by popping in the fridge for around 30 minutes - 1 hour. Or pop in the freezer for 15 minutes if you&#39;re impatient like me.?#&amp;Once fully cooled make the cream cheese frosting&#160;by&#160;adding the butter and cream cheese to a clean mug and beat with a clean fork until softened further. Gradually add in the icing sugar, beating after each addition. You may not need to add in the milk, so only add if needed.?#&amp;Spoon or pipe the frosting over the cooled cake and sprinkle on some&#160;sprinkles, if desired.?#&amp;This cake is best enjoyed immediately or on the same day - cover with plastic wrap and pop in the fridge for later.</Data></Cell>

<Cell><Data ss:Type="String">To make the honeycomb toffee, lightly oil a 8-inch square tin and set aside.?#&amp;In a heavy-based saucepan, add the sugar, vinegar and golden syrup, and heat the mixture gently, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves, then allow the mixture to come to a boil.?#&amp;Clip a sugar thermometer onto the saucepan, then continue to boil the syrup, with no further stirring, until the temperate reaches the soft crack stage at 132&#176;C to 143&#176;C (270&#176;F to 289&#176;F). Immediately remove the pan from the heat and stir in the baking soda. The mixture will bubble up, but continue stirring a little until the bubbles have subsided a little.?#&amp;Working quickly, pour the toffee mixture into the prepared tin — don’t worry about spreading the mixture into the corners, this is not needed. Leave to set until completely cold and hard, then turn out the toffee into a large bowl and break into pieces with the end of a rolling pin, until it reaches the consistency of breadbrumbs. Set aside.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat cones, either temper the dark chocolate or use a compound chocolate (chocolate chips work well). Using a small flat clean paintbrush, paint a thin layer of chocolate over the insides of the mould, ensuring to coat the indents and coating completely, then place in the fridge to set up. Repeat again if necessary.?#&amp;Meanwhile, measure 50g of the previously crushed honeycomb toffee in a small bowl and add the remaining melted chocolate. If the chocolate has started to set, just pop it in the microwave in bursts of 5-10 seconds until it is fluid again. Stir the chocolate in to the crushed honeycomb until fully coated and allow to cool for a few minutes until it&#39;s not hot but not set. If it&#39;s too warm, it will melt the outer coating of chocolate on the moulds.?#&amp;Spoon the chocolate honeycomb mixture into the indents of the mould using a teaspoon. Press the filling down in to the moulds and flatten the tops with the back of your spoon, then allow the Witches’ hat moulds to set in a cool dry place until the filling has set. Once set, turn out the chocolates by flipping the mould out and gently easing out. They should come out easily. If not, just give the tops a gentle tap. Set aside.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat rims, mark 12 circles using a plain round cookie cutter, or a glass slightly bigger than your witches’ hat moulds onto a piece of parchment or alternatively, use a macaron mould. Melt or temper the chocolate as before. Flip the parchment pencil side down on to a baking sheet and drop teaspoons of the melted chocolate onto the parchment paper using the marked circles as guidelines. Allow the chocolate to spread, using your teaspoon to help, if necessary.?#&amp;Repeat with the remaining circles then immediately place a chocolate honeycomb cone in the centre of each chocolate puddle. Allow to set completely.?#&amp;To make the witches&#39; hat ribbons, unravel two liquorice Catherine wheels and cut them into 12 lengths of 9cm, using scissors or a sharp knife.?#&amp;If using fondant, knead until pliable and tint red with gel food colouring. Roll into a sausage and cut into 12 pea-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and cover with plastic wrap to stop them drying out too quickly.?#&amp;Wrap a liquorice strap around each hat, securing together by pressing the red fondant ball over them, then flattening the ball a little. If using M&amp;Ms, see notes on how to attach. Repeat with the remaining hats.?#&amp;Store in a single layer in an airtight container lined with parchment paper at room temperate.</Data></Cell>

Then, in a saucepan, combine the remaining 250ml (1 cup) of double (heavy) cream, milk, sugars, and salt. Cook gently over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sugars have dissolved and the mixture starts to steam. Remove from heat.?#&amp;In a small bowl, whisk egg yolks, then slowly whisk in some of the warm cream mixture, around 1/3&#160;cup at a time, until about half the cream mixture has been incorporated and egg mixture is warm to the touch. Return egg mixture back into saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly and coats the back of a wooden spoon, around 5-7 minutes, or until it reaches approx. 73-76&#176;C (165-170&#176;F). Do not let the mixture boil. Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into the nested bowl of cold cream, discard any remaining solids, then add the vanilla and stir until mixture is cool.?#&amp;Once cool, cover with plastic wrap carefully pressing it onto the surface of the cream mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least hours or preferably overnight.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cookie Dough?#&amp;?#&amp;Combine the butter and sugars in a bowl and beat until light and fluffy. Add salt, vanilla extract, milk (or cream); mix well. Gradually add the flour and mix until incorporated, then stir in the chocolate chips.

Freeze in an ice cream maker following the manufacturers directions until soft serve consistency, then pour into the prepared baking pan and freeze until solid.?#&amp;?#&amp;Cookie Sandwiches?#&amp;?#&amp;Beat together the shortening and sugar for 2-3 minutes, then add baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, espresso powder, and vanilla and mix until incorporated. Mix in 1 cup (100g) flour, followed by 2 tablespoons of water, and then add the remaining 1 cup flour and another 2 tablespoons of water, mixing well until no dry ingredients remain. The dough should be soft and pliable but no sticky; if necessary, add more water until dough comes together.?#&amp;Preheat oven to 180&#176;C (350&#176;F). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into an even &#188;-inch thickness. Cut dough in 3-inch squares, then transfer to a baking sheet lined with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Use a toothpick or cake tester to pole an even pattern of holes onto each cookie’s surface (optional). Repeat rolling and cutting of dough using the scraps if necessary to create 18 cookies, then place the cookie sheets in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. Remove and bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the tops are matte and cookies are just set. Do not over bake.?#&amp;Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, refrigerate or freeze the cookies until ready to use.?#&amp;To assemble the sandwiches, using the foil or parchment paper, carefully lift the block of cookie dough ice cream from the baking pan and place on a cutting board. Using a large knife, cut ice cream into 9 equal squares. Place 1 piece of ice cream between 2 chilled cookies and press lightly to adhere. Freeze the sandwiches until ready to use.</Data></Cell>
