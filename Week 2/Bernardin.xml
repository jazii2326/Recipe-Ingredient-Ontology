Keep jars and sealing discs hot until ready to use.?#&amp;Wash and halve citrus fruit lengthwise; remove and discard seeds. Using a sharp knife, thinly slice across fruit creating paper-thin slices; cut into equal sized pieces about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Place fruit in a large stainless steel saucepan; add water. Bring to a boil; cover and boil gently until peel is tender, about 45 minutes.?#&amp;Measure sugar; set aside.?#&amp;Gradually add sugar, stirring until dissolved. If desired, add 1/2 tsp (2 ml) butter or margarine to reduce foaming. Stirring frequently, bring to a boil over high heat; boil, uncovered, until mixture reaches gel stage, about 1 hour. Remove from heat; skim foam. (Gel test: Remove mixture from heat. Place a spoonful of mixture on plate in freezer for a few minutes; mixture is gelled when it does not run together when separated.)?#&amp;Quickly ladle hot marmalade into a hot jar to within 1/4 inch (0.5 cm) of top of jar (headspace). Using nonmetallic utensil, remove air bubbles. Wipe jar rim removing any stickiness. Centre hot sealing disc on clean jar rim. Screw band down until resistance is met, then increase to fingertip tight. Return filled jar to rack in canner ensuring jars are covered by water. Repeat for remaining marmalade.?#&amp;When canner is filled, ensure that all jars are covered by at least one inch (2.5 cm) of water. Cover canner and bring water to full rolling boil before starting to count processing time. At altitudes up to 1000 ft (305 m), process –boil filled jars – 10 minutes.?#&amp;When processing time is complete, remove canner lid, wait 5 minutes, then remove jars without tilting and place them upright on a protected work surface. Cool upright, undisturbed 24 hours; DO NOT RETIGHTEN screw bands.?#&amp;After cooling check jar seals. Sealed discs curve downward and do not move when pressed. Remove screw bands; wipe and dry bands and jars. Store screw bands separately or replace loosely on jars, as desired. Label and store jars in a cool, dark place.

Excess fat may cause meat to develop a strong flavour and can cause seal failure. Cut meat across grain into uniformly sized slices or cubes, suitable for cooking. Trim away gristle, bruised spots and fat. Do not let meat stand in water.?#&amp;?#&amp;Broth for home canned meat?#&amp;?#&amp;Remove meat from cooking pan. Add 1 cup (250 ml) boiling water for each 2 tbsp (25 ml) fat in pan. Boil 2 to 3 minutes. Do not add thickening agent such as flour or cornstarch before canning. Thicken liquids only when prepared for serving.?#&amp;Place the required number of clean 500 ml or 1 L mason jars on rack in pressure canner; add water and heat jars to a simmer (180&#176;F/82&#176;C). Set screw bands aside; heat SNAP LID&#174; sealing discs in hot water, not boiling (180&#176;F/82&#176;C). Keep jars and sealing discs hot until ready to use.?#&amp;Grind fresh pork. Season pork to taste with spices and herbs such as salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, oregano and basil. (Avoid sage as a seasoning, because it can become bitter during storage). Shape mixture into patties or 3-4 inch links. Cook until lightly browned. Drain. Season.?#&amp;Pack hot prepared pork patties or links and hot broth into a hot jar to within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of top rim (head space).?#&amp;Using nonmetallic utensil, remove air bubbles. Wipe jar rim removing any stickiness. Centre hot sealing disc on clean jar rim. Screw band down until resistance is met, then increase to fingertip tight. Return filled jar to rack in canner. Repeat for remaining patties or links and broth. If stacking jars, place a second rack between layers of jars.?#&amp;When pressure canner is full, adjust water to level as directed by canner manufacturer. Lock canner lid in place and follow manufacturer’s heating instructions. Vent canner–allow steam to escape steadily–for 10 minutes; close vent.?#&amp;When canner reaches the pressure appropriate for your altitude* and type of pressure canner, begin counting processing time. Process – heat filled jars – – for time indicated: 500 ml jars 75 minutes; 1 L jars – 90 minutes.?#&amp;NOTE: processing times indicated are for a weighted gauge pressure canner used at altitudes up to 1,000 ft (305 m). When using a dial gauge pressure canner or canning at higher elevations, adjust pressure according to chart.?#&amp;When processing time is complete turn off heat. Allow canner to stand undisturbed until pressure drops to zero. Wait 2 minutes, and then remove cover, tilting it away from your face. Remove jars without tilting. Cool upright, undisturbed 24 hours; DO NOT RETIGHTEN screw bands. After cooling check jar seals. Sealed discs curve downward. Remove screw bands; wipe and dry bands and jars. Store screw bands separately or replace loosely on jars, as desired. Label and store in a cool, dark place.?#&amp;?#&amp;</Data></Cell>
