However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&?#&Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks.

On the grill, the meat is going to hang on skewers to be as far away from the flame as possible and then transition to the grates at the end to ensure all pieces are fully dehydrated over the course of the cook.?#&?#&Directions?#&?#&Combine all the ingredients for the marinade, then pulse with a stick blender/immersion blender to fully mix all ingredients together and chop the fresh garlic.?#&Slice the meat into 1/4” slices, removing all fat. Cut it in half so each strip is no longer than 5 inches in length and no longer than 4 inches in width.?#&In large gallon zip lock bags, add the meat and the marinade and let marinate in the fridge overnight.?#&?#&After removing from the fridge?#&?#&Double up the skewers so that each piece is hanging from two skewers. The double skewers ensure the weight of the meat doesn’t cause the skewer to break. Make sure the meat pieces are not touching each other. Leave enough room on each end (approximately 4 inches) of the skewer so that there is room to hang on the rods of the PBC.?#&Fill less than half of a standard chimney starter with Kingsford Charcoal and ignite it. Don’t let it get fully lit- only 3/4 of the way. Dump the charcoal into the Charcoal Ring and move it to one side.?#&On the opposite side of the charcoal, hang your skewers on the rods suspending your jerky above the unlit/indirect side of the charcoal.?#&Add your preferred wood to the fire.?#&Let the jerky smoke for 2 hours (lid closed), watching it very closely the ENTIRE time. The skewers closest to the flame will need to be rotated to the other end of the barrel so they do not overcook. Add charcoal briquettes as needed to maintain the fire but never letting it get too big or hot.?#&**If using lump charcoal, use the same amount of charcoal in the starter. However, you can use a spray bottle and mist the lump if it is getting too hot. This cannot be done with Kingsford as it gets sandy/mushy.?#&After the jerky has dehydrated and cooked down- approximately two hours or so, some pieces may still have “wet spots” or areas that may have touched others or haven’t fully dehydrated. At this point, remove the jerky and rods and add the grate. Remove the jerky pieces and lay on the grate on the indirect side. Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC! This could take 30 minutes to an hour.?#&Once all “wet” spots are dehydrated and the jerky has reduced in size and is firm yet still flexible, it is ready to eat.?#&?#&Store in the refrigerator for maximum freshness- the jerky will last a few weeks.

Some pieces may already be done and will not need this final step.?#&Let these remaining pieces continue to dehydrate on indirect until there are no “wet” parts left on the jerky, this will be a manual process- keep an eye on your PBC!

Oil the grate so the meat will not stick. Place the meat on its side on the grate. Add your preferred wood for smoke- I added cherry wood. Cook until you reach an internal temperature of 140 degrees as measured with an internal read thermometer (I recommend the Thermapen for accurate internal temperature readings). This should take approximately 2 ½ hrs depending on the weather conditions.?#&?#&Remove the bologna from the grate. Glaze with the BBQ glaze. Don’t overdo the sauce; use just enough to coat the bologna. Put the bologna back on the PBC and cook for 10-15 minutes. Just enough to set the glaze.?#&?#&Remove and loosely cover the bologna with aluminum foil while you prep for your bologna sandwich. Take two pieces of Wonder Texas Toast, lie them on the grate and cook with the lid off until you see some grill marks.  Slice the bologna to your desired thickness and then put mayonnaise, tomato, sliced onion and lettuce on your sandwich and enjoy.');

Once they have reduced down, keep them on a very low simmer.?#&?#&Grill the shrimp, sausage and peppers until cooked through. The shrimp will cook most quickly- remove them as soon as they begin to turn pink. Remove the sausage once an internal temp of 145 degrees with a Thermapen has been reached and the peppers can be removed once they have developed char marks.?#&?#&Once the shrimp, peppers and sausage have cooked on the grill, remove them and set aside on a cutting board to let cool slightly so they can be chopped. Meanwhile, add the milk, cheese and butter to the grits and stir to combine and let thicken over a low simmer. Add salt, pepper, and smoked paprika to the grits.  Chop the peppers and sausage and remove the tails off the shrimp. Ladle grits ½ cup at a time into bowls. Add shrimp, peppers and sausage and garnish with chopped parsley.?#&?#&Serve with your favorite hot sauce, and additional salt and pepper. I hope you and your family enjoy this Southern inspired dish as much as mine does! Cheers!');

Expose as much of the meat as possible the set it aside. Goat can be a rather tough meat if prepared incorrectly. The best way to tenderize the meat is a good brine. Take the first 2 bottles of Guinness and pour them into a small stock pot. Open the 3rd bottle and enjoy. Add the 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt to the Guinness and simmer until dissolved. Add 3 cups of water to the mixture and allow it to cool. Place the goat leg in a container large enough that it can lay flat and pour the Guinness brine over the leg.  Leave in the brine for 3-5 hours rotating the leg every 30 mins. While we brine the leg…may as well have that other bottle of Guinness.?#&?#&This would also be a great time to start working on the next step – BACON WEAVNG. Take a large sheet of aluminum foil (Large enough to cover the goat leg) and begin weaving. Think back to elementary school and making mats out of construction paper….it is the same, but with tasty, tasty bacon. If you aren’t a master bacon weaver, don’t worries you can lay out the bacon in overlapping strips.  This would also be a good time to bring your smoker up to 225 degrees.?#&?#&After 3-5 hrs, remove the goat leg from the brine and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the entire leg down with the softened butter and minced garlic. Once rubbed down, sprinkle the shredded mint leaves over the leg. Now wrap the bacon around the leg. Make sure you leave no gaps…add more bacon. Now that it is happily wrapped in bacon wrap the leg in aluminum foil. Place the leg in the smoker and cook 12-14 hrs (depending on the size of the leg) at 225 degrees.?#&?#&Take a nap…have a drink or two, like Robyn’s Grilled Margaritas.?#&?#&An hour or so before the meat is done start working on your Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze and Blue Cheese Sauce.?#&?#&Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze: Pour the wine into a medium sauce pan. Add the onion powder, garlic, cayenne and black pepper. Bring the mix to boil for 2-3 min then bring the heat down to a simmer for 10- 15 min.  Remove from heat and set to the side.  Pour yourself a glass or two of wine. It’s not too early is it??#&?#&Blue Cheese Sauce: Add the garlic, onions, and fire-roasted pepper to a large skillet and heat until the onions begin to sweat. Add the blue cheese and heavy cream to the mix and continue stirring until the cheese is blended smooth.?#&?#&Now that the goat has been on for the 12-14 hours remove it from the smoker and allow it to rest 15 – 20 mins in the foil. Unwrap the foil and the bacon…but don’t discard the bacon…its bacon…eat it…It’s awesome. Pull the meat from the leg like you would a pork shoulder.  Place the meat on toasted wheat rolls.  Drizzle the cracked pepper wine glaze over the pulled goat.  Spoon the blue cheese sauce over top of the meat. Add a piece of lettuce or spinach and Viola!  Pour yourself a drink and Bon Appetite!”');

NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay.

As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&?#&Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender.

It’s important that you thickly cut your apples so they don’t break on the grill. Remove the grilling apples from the grill and slice them smaller, since I was working with a small tart pan I cut all the apples {the Grilled Granny Smith + Red Delicious into bite sized pieces}.  Add the grilled apples to your butter/apple mixture and set aside.?#&?#&Roll out your pie dough and cut into small circles {or use the entire circle if you are making a large pie}. Pour the apple filling into each and make sure you get a good amount of the apple/butter sauce as well. I played around with the pie tops and did a lattice design on a few and a regular pie crust on the top. If doing a full pie crust just remember to cut a few slits on the time to vent and sprinkle a little sugar on the top.?#&?#&Grill the mini pies on indirect heat for about 15 minutes and make sure to quarter turn them halfway in between. Keep a close eye these grill up quickly especially if you are making mini pies like I did. A whole pie would need about 35 – 45 minutes.');

If the cornmeal is very coarse, pulse in the food processor before baking with it for a finer texture. Gluten-free all-purpose flour can easily be used in any baking recipe – I recommend “Cup for Cup” all-purpose gluten-free flour. It can easily be found on Amazon.com.?#&?#&Pairing Suggestions/Maximizing Leftovers: For a sweeter cornbread without adding extra calories, add 2 tablespoons stevia in the raw to the batter before baking. This cornbread is great paired with any dish that comes out of the smoker!');

If the cornmeal is very coarse, pulse in the food processor before baking with it for a finer texture. Gluten-free all-purpose flour can easily be used in any baking recipe – I recommend “Cup for Cup” all-purpose gluten-free flour. It can easily be found on Amazon.com.?#&?#&Pairing Suggestions/Maximizing Leftovers: For a sweeter cornbread without adding extra calories, add 2 tablespoons stevia in the raw to the batter before baking. This cornbread is great paired with any dish that comes out of the smoker!');

Slice the remaining half-peach thinly lengthwise. Finely chop the poblano, also reserving a few pieces for the top.?#&?#&Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until combined. Add the chopped peaches and poblanos and fold in. Pour the batter into the cast iron skillet. In the middle of the skillet, arrange the remaining peach slices in a circle in the middle. Sprinkle remaining chopped poblanos on top –  this will make for an eye-catching presentation once baked.?#&?#&Bake the cornbread for 20-25 minutes until browned and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Serve with butter and honey. I dare you to eat just one piece!?#&?#&Tip Bubble: Blue cornmeal can be found from Anson Mills, War Eagle Farms, and Bob’s Red Mill. If the cornmeal is very coarse, pulse in the food processor before baking with it for a finer texture. Gluten-free all-purpose flour can easily be used in any baking recipe – I recommend “Cup for Cup” all-purpose gluten-free flour. It can easily be found on Amazon.com.?#&?#&Pairing Suggestions/Maximizing Leftovers: For a sweeter cornbread without adding extra calories, add 2 tablespoons stevia in the raw to the batter before baking. This cornbread is great paired with any dish that comes out of the smoker!');

As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&?#&Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender.

Expose as much of the meat as possible the set it aside. Goat can be a rather tough meat if prepared incorrectly. The best way to tenderize the meat is a good brine. Take the first 2 bottles of Guinness and pour them into a small stock pot. Open the 3rd bottle and enjoy. Add the 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp of salt to the Guinness and simmer until dissolved. Add 3 cups of water to the mixture and allow it to cool. Place the goat leg in a container large enough that it can lay flat and pour the Guinness brine over the leg.  Leave in the brine for 3-5 hours rotating the leg every 30 mins. While we brine the leg…may as well have that other bottle of Guinness.?#&?#&This would also be a great time to start working on the next step – BACON WEAVNG. Take a large sheet of aluminum foil (Large enough to cover the goat leg) and begin weaving. Think back to elementary school and making mats out of construction paper….it is the same, but with tasty, tasty bacon. If you aren’t a master bacon weaver, don’t worries you can lay out the bacon in overlapping strips.  This would also be a good time to bring your smoker up to 225 degrees.?#&?#&After 3-5 hrs, remove the goat leg from the brine and pat dry with a paper towel. Rub the entire leg down with the softened butter and minced garlic. Once rubbed down, sprinkle the shredded mint leaves over the leg. Now wrap the bacon around the leg. Make sure you leave no gaps…add more bacon. Now that it is happily wrapped in bacon wrap the leg in aluminum foil. Place the leg in the smoker and cook 12-14 hrs (depending on the size of the leg) at 225 degrees.?#&?#&Take a nap…have a drink or two, like Robyn’s Grilled Margaritas.?#&?#&An hour or so before the meat is done start working on your Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze and Blue Cheese Sauce.?#&?#&Cracked Pepper Red Wine Glaze: Pour the wine into a medium sauce pan. Add the onion powder, garlic, cayenne and black pepper. Bring the mix to boil for 2-3 min then bring the heat down to a simmer for 10- 15 min.  Remove from heat and set to the side.  Pour yourself a glass or two of wine. It’s not too early is it??#&?#&Blue Cheese Sauce: Add the garlic, onions, and fire-roasted pepper to a large skillet and heat until the onions begin to sweat. Add the blue cheese and heavy cream to the mix and continue stirring until the cheese is blended smooth.?#&?#&Now that the goat has been on for the 12-14 hours remove it from the smoker and allow it to rest 15 – 20 mins in the foil. Unwrap the foil and the bacon…but don’t discard the bacon…its bacon…eat it…It’s awesome. Pull the meat from the leg like you would a pork shoulder.  Place the meat on toasted wheat rolls.  Drizzle the cracked pepper wine glaze over the pulled goat.  Spoon the blue cheese sauce over top of the meat. Add a piece of lettuce or spinach and Viola!  Pour yourself a drink and Bon Appetite!”');

As char marks form, turn the veggies over and let the other side cook. Ideally you are looking for good char marks and the veggies and watermelon to caramelize on the grill. NOTE, the watermelon will not get as charred as the rest of the veggies unless you sliced it extremely thin and that is okay. The inherent nature of this fruit having so much water content takes it longer to get char marks- be patient. As veggies develop the char marks, remove them and let them cool in a big bowl.?#&?#&Once all veggies have been remove, place them in the largest pot you have and get out your stick blender.

Oil the grill grates so your ingredients don’t stick.?#&?#&Cut your iceberg wedge in half (you will then cut again when serving but it it is best to keep in halves for grilling), along with your tomatoes. Grill the iceberg, inside part down, for about five minutes, until nice char marks have formed. Grill your tomatoes on all sides to get as much flavor from the grill as possible. Once you’ve obtained nice char marks, remove from the grill and let cool for a few tomatoes.?#&?#&Slice the iceberg halves again and you will end up with 4 wedges. Divide among 4 plates and then add your tomatoes. Next, spoon your dressing generously over the lettuce. Now, for the grand finale. Crumble your bacon slices and divide among your plates. This makes for a beautiful presentation and is fun way to start an outdoor dinner party! This is also great as an entree- use an iceberg halve and add more bacon! MMM… bacon!');
