Set aside.?#&To make the witches'' hat rims, mark 12 circles using a plain round cookie cutter, or a glass slightly bigger than your witches’ hat moulds onto a piece of parchment or alternatively, use a macaron mould. Melt or temper the chocolate as before. Flip the parchment pencil side down on to a baking sheet and drop teaspoons of the melted chocolate onto the parchment paper using the marked circles as guidelines.
